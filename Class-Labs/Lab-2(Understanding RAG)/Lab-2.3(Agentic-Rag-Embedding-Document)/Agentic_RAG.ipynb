        "\n",
        "A **Knowledge Graph** is a structured representation of information that connects data points using relationships. It organizes and links concepts, entities, and facts in a way that allows machines (like AI) to understand and reason about the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Components of a Knowledge Graph\n",
        "1. **Entities (Nodes)** – Objects or concepts (e.g., a company, a contract, a product).\n",
        "2. **Relationships (Edges)** – Connections between entities (e.g., \"Customer **has** a Master Agreement\").\n",
        "3. **Attributes (Properties)** – Details about entities (e.g., \"Contract Start Date: Jan 2024\").\n",
        "\n",
        "## Example of a Simple Knowledge Graph\n",
        "\n",
        "### 📌 Entities:\n",
        "- **Customer**: ABC Corp\n",
        "- **Master Agreement**: Contract\n",
        "- **Service Order**: Specific service agreement\n",

        "### 📌 Relationships:\n",
        "- `ABC Corp → has → Master Agreement`\n",
        "- `Master Agreement → includes → Service Order`\n",

        "## Why Use a Knowledge Graph?\n",
        "- 🚀 Helps AI understand context better\n",
