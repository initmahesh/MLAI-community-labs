        "\n",
        "By the end of this lab, you'll gain a deep understanding of **Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** and how it revolutionizes the way we interact with documents. Here's what you'll learn:\n",

        "#### **1. Storing Documents Intelligently Using Vector Embeddings** 🗂️\n",
        "- **What**: Learn how to convert documents into numerical representations (vector embeddings) that capture their meaning.\n",
        "- **How**: Use **ChromaDB**, a vector database, to store and organize these embeddings efficiently.\n",
        "- **Why**: This allows the system to understand and retrieve information based on semantic meaning, not just keywords.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### **2. Retrieving Information with Semantic Understanding** 🔍\n",
        "- **What**: Discover how to fetch relevant information from a large document collection using semantic search.\n",
        "- **How**: Leverage **LangChain** to query ChromaDB and retrieve the most contextually relevant chunks.\n",
        "- **Why**: This ensures that the system understands the intent behind your questions, not just the literal words.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### **3. Generating Context-Aware Answers Using Agentic Decision-Making** 🤖\n",
        "- **What**: Explore how **Agentic RAG** makes smart decisions about how to answer questions.\n",
        "- **How**: Implement a decision-making agent that evaluates the confidence of retrieved information and chooses the best response strategy.\n",
        "- **Why**: This allows the system to provide accurate and contextually appropriate answers, even when the information is incomplete or ambiguous.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **4. Optimizing Responses Through Knowledge Graph Enhancements** 🧠\n",
        "- **What**: Learn how to enhance answers by connecting related concepts using a knowledge graph.\n",
        "- **How**: Build a knowledge graph that maps terms and relationships (e.g., \"Master Agreement\" → \"Contract\") to improve understanding.\n",
        "- **Why**: This enables the system to provide more comprehensive and insightful answers by leveraging contextual connections.\n",
