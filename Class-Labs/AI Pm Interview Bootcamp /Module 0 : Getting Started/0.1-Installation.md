### **→ Overview**  
 
Module 0.1 is all about setting up Claude Code and completing the authentication process. This section acts as a handy reference to guide you alongside the hands-on tutorial.

Quick Note : Using Claude Code requires Node.js version 18 or higher and an active Claude subscription. Once these requirements are ready, the setup process is quick and can be completed in just a few minutes.

### **→ Prerequisites**
| Requirement | Details |
|------------|--------|
| Node.js | Node.js version 18 or above must be installed on your system. |
| Visual Studio Code (VS Code) | VS Code must be installed to connect and use Claude Code. |
| Operating System | A supported operating system: macOS or Windows 10 and later. |

### **→ Tools We’ll Use and Why**

Even if you’re not a developer, it helps to understand **what these tools are** and **why we use them** in this course:  

1. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):**  
   VS Code is a **workspace for writing and organizing code**. Think of it like a smart notebook where you can see files, run code, and test things all in one place. It helps you work efficiently with Claude Code.
   [VS Code Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs)  

2. **Node.js:**  
   Node.js is a platform that lets your computer **run JavaScript outside of a web browser**. Many tools, including Claude Code, need Node.js to work properly.

3. **Claude Code:**  
   Claude Code is the **tool we’ll use to build, test, and document AI product workflows**. It connects with VS Code to help you interact with AI models, run your tasks, and see results quickly.

> Even if you don’t dive deep into coding, these tools provide a structured environment to follow along, experiment, and understand AI workflows.
