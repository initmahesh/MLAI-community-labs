## **follow these steps in your terminal:**

1️⃣ Create a ~/.zshrc file
```bash
touch ~/.zshrc
```


2️⃣ Add nvm initialization to it
```bash
echo 'export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo '[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

3️⃣ Load the file in the current terminal
