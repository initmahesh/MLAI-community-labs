## Module 0: Getting Started

### 0.0 Introduction

#### **Overview**  
This course is built for AI Product Managers who want to move from *talking about AI* to *building, evaluating, and defending AI product decisions with confidence*. The bar for AI PM roles has changed. It’s no longer enough to understand AI concepts, write PRDs, or speak in frameworks — hiring teams now expect PMs who can prototype ideas, reason about AI system behavior, and show real judgment.

In this program, you’ll work primarily inside **VS Code with Claude Code** as your core tools. Instead of treating AI as a separate chatbot or a theoretical layer, you’ll integrate it directly into how you think, build, and document products. You’ll learn how modern AI PMs actually work — close to the system, close to the decisions, and close to execution.

**Key takeaway:** This course turns AI PMs into *builder-orchestrators*. You define the product intent, constraints, and success metrics — Claude Code helps you explore, prototype, and evaluate faster, directly inside your working environment.




## What You’ll Build

This course teaches you to build an end-to-end AI PM operating system using VS Code and Claude Code.

- **Hands-on AI prototypes** that demonstrate real product thinking  
- **AI-first PRDs and decision docs** grounded in evaluation, not hype  
- **Agent workflows** that reflect how AI systems are actually designed  
- **Clear evaluation frameworks** for choosing models, prompts, and trade-offs  

While you’ll get exposure to external tools through hands on labs, **VS Code and Claude Code remain the primary tools** you’ll use throughout the course.
## Requirements

- Claude Pro or Max subscription  
- VS Code installed on Mac, Windows, or Linux  
- Basic familiarity with PM concepts (PRDs, user flows, metrics)  
- Willingness to learn by building, not just watching  

Time investment is structured like a bootcamp experience, designed to create strong signal quickly and compound over time.

## Real AI PM Use Cases Covered

**Market, User & PRD Foundations**
- Translate market and user research into AI-aware product requirements  
- Write PRDs that account for uncertainty, model behavior, and system limits  

**Agents & System Design**
- Build single-agent workflows for focused tasks  
- Create multi-agent workflows where agents collaborate to solve problems  
- Understand how to break product problems into clear agent responsibilities  


**Evaluation & Decision-Making**
- Choose the right benchmarks for your product goals  
- Compare and rank models using meaningful criteria  
- Convert qualitative judgment into measurable signals  

**Career & Interviews**
- Show how you think, not just what you know  
- Defend AI product decisions with clarity and maturity  
- Walk into AI PM interviews with proof, not promises 
## The Mindset Shift

> Great AI PMs aren’t defined by how well they explain AI — but by how well they *evaluate and shape it*.

This course drives a fundamental shift:

**From:** Slides, theory, and surface-level AI knowledge  
**To:** Prototypes, evaluations, and real product judgment

## What’s Next?
- **0.1:** Installing Visual Studio Code  
- **0.2:** Connecting Claude Code with VS Code  
- **0.3:** Your First Claude Code Demo  

By the end of Module 0, you’ll be fully set up and have your first hands-on experience working like a modern AI PM who builds, evaluates, and reasons in systems.
