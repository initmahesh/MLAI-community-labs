## Module Overview

As a Product Manager, research is fundamental. Every product decision you make needs to be backed by evidence, not just gut feelings. Module 1 focuses on teaching you how to do research the right way using Claude Code.

We'll cover two essential types of research that every PM needs to master:

- **Market Research** — Understanding what's out there, who you're competing with, and where the opportunities are
- **User Research** — Understanding what your users actually need, not what you think they need

Instead of working manually, you'll learn how to use Claude Code as an **AI-powered research assistant**, enabling you to gather insights, analyze data, and create documentation in minutes instead of days.
