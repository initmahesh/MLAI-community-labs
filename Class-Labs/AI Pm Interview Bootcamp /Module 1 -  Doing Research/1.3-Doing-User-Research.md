# 1.2: User Research

![banner](./marketreserachimages/ubanner.png)

## **→ Overview**

User research is the process of understanding users by studying their needs, behaviors, motivations, pain points, and goals. It involves methods such as interviews, surveys, observations, and usability testing to gather insights directly from users and their real-world experiences.

User research helps teams move from assumptions to evidence. It ensures that what is being built actually solves real problems. Key benefits include:

- Identifying real user needs and pain points  
- Reducing risk by validating ideas early  
- Making better decisions based on data, not opinions  
- Improving usability, satisfaction, and adoption  
- Creating solutions that truly add value  

---

### **→ Why User Research Is Important**

User research supports teams in making strong, user-centered decisions. It allows them to:

- Understand user problems deeply before defining solutions  
- Prioritize features and requirements effectively  
- Align stakeholders around real user insights  
- Minimize rework and wasted effort  
- Deliver products that achieve both user and business success  

In this module, we will conduct **structured user research using Claude Code**, leveraging it as an AI-powered research assistant. We will build on the **market research data completed in the previous lab**, using it as input to understand user behaviors, validate assumptions, uncover pain points, and synthesize insights that can be translated directly into clear, actionable product decisions.

---

## **→ Prerequisites**

Before beginning this module, make sure you have **completed Module 0 and the Market Research lab**.

These ensure that:

- Claude Code is installed and working correctly  
- Your terminal and VS Code are properly configured  
- Your Claude account is connected and authorized  
- You have completed the Market Research lab and generated market insights  
- You are comfortable running and interacting with Claude Code  

---

## **→ Hands On**

Now that you're fully set up, it's time to get hands-on. We'll begin applying Claude Code to perform structured user research step by step, building on the **market research data we generated in the previous lab**.

---

### Step 1: Open VS Code and Set Up Your Workspace

Open your VS Code application and navigate to the folder you created in **Module 0**.

### Step 3: Set Up Claude Code System Message for User Research

In this step, we will configure the **Claude Code system message** to guide the AI to act as a **User Research Assistant**. This setup ensures that all interactions and outputs from Claude Code are focused on gathering, analyzing, and synthesizing user insights effectively.

The prompt sets the system message, specifying that Claude should:

- Understand user behaviors, needs, and pain points  
- Analyze qualitative and quantitative data  
- Provide actionable insights to inform product decisions  
- Build on the market research data from the previous lab  

This step establishes the foundation for all subsequent user research activities in this module.

#### **Prompt**

```text
ROLE
You are an expert User Research Analyst specializing in understanding user behavior, needs, pain points, motivations, and preferences. Your goal is to provide actionable, user-centric insights that inform product decisions, improve user experience, increase adoption, and reduce churn.

CRITICAL RULE: NO FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS
You MUST provide a complete answer based on available information. NEVER ask clarifying questions. If information is incomplete, make reasonable assumptions based on context, state your assumptions, and deliver meaningful insights.

YOUR APPROACH

1. Understand the Question
Identify the specific user insight needed and the underlying product or business objective.

2. Gather & Analyze Data
Use available sources: user behavior analytics, surveys, support tickets, feature usage metrics, usability findings, satisfaction scores (NPS, CSAT), churn and retention data. When market research is provided as context, translate market-level insights into user-level findings.

3. Synthesize Insights
Identify patterns across data sources, extract common themes, segment users by behavior or needs, distinguish between what users say and do, prioritize by frequency and impact.

4. Provide Actionable Recommendations
Translate insights into clear findings, explain why behind user behavior, highlight critical pain points, quantify impact when possible, connect to product or UX improvements.

OUTPUT STRUCTURE

Key Findings
2-3 most important insights discovered

Detailed Analysis
User Behavior Patterns: What users are actually doing
Pain Points & Frustrations: What is causing problems
User Needs & Desires: What users want or are missing
Sentiment Analysis: How users feel (positive, negative, neutral trends)

User Segments (if applicable)
Different user groups and their defining characteristics

Recommendations
Specific, actionable next steps based on findings

Data Considerations
Assumptions made and data limitations (brief)

GUIDELINES

Be Data-Driven: Ground insights in data, cite metrics when available, distinguish quantitative from qualitative data
Be User-Centric: Advocate for user perspective, empathize with frustrations, consider diverse segments
Be Actionable: Propose solutions, prioritize by impact, make recommendations specific and implementable
Be Objective: Present both positive and negative findings, avoid bias, acknowledge limitations
Be Clear & Decisive: Use plain language, explain technical metrics in business terms, always provide complete answers

HANDLING AMBIGUOUS QUERIES
When queries lack specifics, use these defaults without asking:
- Feature unclear → Analyze core and most-used features
- Time period unclear → Assume last 30-90 days
- User segment unclear → Analyze all users, then segment where relevant
- Metrics unclear → Focus on engagement, retention, and satisfaction
```

After pasting your prompt, the Claude Code input field will look like this. Just press **Enter**.

![terminal](./marketreserachimages/step31.png)

After successfully submitting the prompt, it will show you something like "Next step will be providing query."

![terminal](./marketreserachimages/u1.png)

---

### Step 4: Run Your User Research Query

In this step, we will run a **user research query** in Claude Code.

> **Note:** Claude Code acts as a memory management system and will automatically retrieve the previous market research context from your previous lab session. You don't need to specify the filename - it will automatically use the market research data you generated earlier.

**Query:**

```text
Based on analyzing my market research report conduct user research for project management tools to understand:
- User behavior patterns
- Key pain points and frustrations
- User needs and unmet expectations
- Feature usage and preferences
- Reasons for adoption, switching, or churn

Translate the market-level insights into user-level findings and actionable recommendations. Save the user research results in a file named userresearch.txt.

```

![terminal](./marketreserachimages/u2.png)

---

### Step 5: Save Your User Research Results

After running your user research query, Claude Code will prompt you to save the results.

- Select the **second option** if you want to perform additional iterations or refine the results.  
- Otherwise, you can proceed with the **default option** to save the file directly.  

The results will be saved in `userresearch.txt` as specified in your query.

![terminal](./marketreserachimages/u3.png)

---

### Step 6: Verify the User Research File

Once the process is complete, you can check your workspace folder. Claude Code will have created a **`userresearch.txt`** file containing all the user research insights and actionable recommendations generated from your query.

---

## **→ Conclusion**

Now you have seen how **easy it is to conduct user research with Claude Code**. You don't need to interview dozens of users manually, analyze surveys by hand, or spend hours synthesizing data.

Claude Code does the heavy lifting for you: it leverages existing market research, gathers user insights, analyzes patterns, and **provides a complete user research report** in a file (`userresearch.txt`) based on your query.

---

## **→ Next Steps**

In the next module, we will learn how to write a **Product Requirement Document (PRD)** using Claude Code. This PRD will be informed by both the **market research** and **user research** data we have collected in the previous labs, allowing us to translate insights directly into actionable product specifications and feature priorities.
