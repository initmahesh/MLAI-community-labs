## What is a Product Requirements Document?

Let's start with the basics. A Product Requirements Document, or PRD, is a high-level document that outlines the features and attributes of the product you're working on. Think of it as your product development blueprint.

At the beginning of a development initiative, your team works with stakeholders to set requirements and agree on a plan of action. Then you document that conversation in a PRD so everyone knows what details your product team needs to remember.

Within a few pages, a PRD must explain:
- The product or service you're creating
- Its target audience
- How the product benefits the end user
- What features it will have
- How success will be measured

You'll generally create a PRD at the beginning of the process, but there are some steps that come before it, like brainstorming and market analysis (which you've already done in Module 1).

## Why PRDs Matter

If you've ever missed an essential project detail, you know the frustration, rework, and even financial losses that oversight causes. Excellent project planning prevents those mistakes.

A PRD is your ultimate product development checklist. It gives you the confidence you need to launch because it addresses even the most minute details from the get-go, helping you deliver quality products without hiccups (at least, the ones you can plan for).

Here's what a good PRD does for you:

**Prevents Miscommunication**
- Everyone on the team knows exactly what's being built
- No more "I thought we were doing X" moments
- Clear alignment between engineering, design, and stakeholders

**Reduces Rework**
- Catch issues before development starts
- Validate assumptions early
- Avoid building the wrong thing

**Sets Clear Expectations**
- Everyone knows what's in scope and what's not
- Success criteria are defined upfront
- Release criteria are clear

**Serves as a Reference**
- When questions come up, the PRD has the answers
- New team members can get up to speed quickly
- Decisions are documented, not lost in Slack threads

## How to Write a Product Requirements Document


![banner](./marketreserachimages/p1.png)

The most streamlined PRDs cover the product's basic purpose, goals, features, and release criteria. But many docs are more extensive, and being thorough is wise, considering that all forthcoming tasks will point back to it.

Here's how to write a PRD that leaves no stone unturned:

---

### Step 1: Define the Product

In your opening, summarize your plan. This is where you set the stage for everything that follows.

**What to include:**
- **Product name and description**: What are you building?
- **Project team and stakeholders**: Who's involved?
- **Tentative release date**: When are you aiming to launch?
- **Product purpose**: What pain points does it alleviate?
- **Target audience**: Who is the buyer persona?
- **Value proposition**: How does the product create value for the end user?

**Example:**
> We're building a reading habit tracking app that integrates with major ebook platforms. The app will help users track their reading habits and preferences in one place, regardless of where they source their books. Our target audience is avid readers who use multiple platforms and want better insights into their reading patterns.

---

### Step 2: Determine Goals

Write the team's objectives for the product development process. This section lets you delve deeper into why this product benefits both the end user and the company that's creating it.

**Best practice:** Generate SMART goals — specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound — that can later serve as goalposts.

**What to include:**
- **User goals**: What problems are you solving for users?
- **Business goals**: What does the company want to achieve?
- **Product goals**: What should the product accomplish?

**Example:**
- Goal 1: Integrate with all major ebook applications
- Goal 2: Create the leading app of its kind in the market
- Goal 3: Ensure accurate understanding of user reading preferences

---

### Step 3: Identify Assumptions and Constraints

Assumptions are the points or roadblocks you know you'll meet during the product development process, usually involving end-user needs. Constraints refer to unknown external pressures or limitations that have the potential to negatively impact workflow.

**Assumptions might include:**
- Users want to track reading across multiple platforms
- Users are willing to connect their accounts
- Integration APIs are available and stable

**Constraints might include:**
- Working with a new supplier or integration partner
- Limited development resources
- Timeline restrictions
- Technical limitations

Defining them from the start lets you more accurately determine final expectations for the product.

**Example:**
> **Assumptions:**
> - Users primarily use 2-3 major ebook platforms
> - Users want automated tracking rather than manual entry
> 
> **Constraints:**
> - Some ebook platforms may not have public APIs
> - Development team is limited to 3 engineers
> - Must launch within 6 months

---

### Step 4: Limit the Scope of Work

Define what is and isn't within the project scope. No matter the type of project, setting boundaries will help prevent scope creep and keep the team on track.

**What to include:**
- **In scope**: Features and functionality that will be included
- **Out of scope**: Features explicitly not included (but might be considered for future versions)
- **Future considerations**: Things you're aware of but deferring

**Example:**
> **In Scope:**
> - Integration with top 5 ebook platforms
> - Reading habit tracking and analytics
> - Basic user preferences storage
> 
> **Out of Scope:**
> - Social features (sharing with friends)
> - Book recommendations engine
> - Mobile apps (web app only for v1)
> 
> **Future Considerations:**
> - Mobile apps for iOS and Android
> - Integration with library systems
> - Community features

---

### Step 5: List Features

Identify the product's primary features, describing how end users will use the item, service, or software. Describe each requirement in as much detail as possible so any teammate or stakeholder who's reviewing the document will understand what's within scope.

The PRD is all about requirements, so this section should be robust.

**What to include for each feature:**
- **Feature name**: Clear, descriptive name
- **Description**: What the feature does
- **User story**: How users will interact with it
- **Acceptance criteria**: What needs to be true for this feature to be considered complete
- **Priority**: Must-have, should-have, or nice-to-have

**Example:**
> **Feature: Multi-Platform Integration**
> 
> **Description:** Users can connect their accounts from major ebook platforms (Kindle, Apple Books, Google Play Books, Kobo, Nook) to automatically sync reading data.
> 
> **User Story:** As a reader, I want to connect my ebook accounts so that my reading habits are tracked automatically without manual entry.
> 
> **Acceptance Criteria:**
> - User can authenticate with at least 3 major platforms
> - Reading data syncs automatically daily
> - User can disconnect accounts at any time
> - Error handling for failed syncs
> 
> **Priority:** Must-have

---

### Step 6: Define Release Criteria

In this step, identify the criteria that will determine whether your product is customer-ready. This might include notes on functionality, usability, and reliability.

Once you check off these release criteria boxes, you can feel confident that you're launching a quality product to a target audience that will be eager to use it.

**What to include:**
- **Functional requirements**: Core features must work as specified
- **Performance requirements**: Speed, responsiveness, uptime
- **Usability requirements**: User experience standards
- **Security requirements**: Data protection, authentication
- **Quality requirements**: Bug thresholds, testing coverage

**Example:**
> **Release Criteria:**
> - All must-have features are implemented and tested
> - App loads in under 2 seconds
> - 99.9% uptime for data syncing
> - User authentication is secure (OAuth 2.0)
> - Zero critical bugs
> - User acceptance testing completed with 10+ beta users
> - Documentation is complete

---

### Step 7: Set Metrics for Success

Decide on a methodology for approving work and ensuring the customer readiness that you described in the steps above. When you begin the product development project, you can track these metrics and make sure you aren't missing anything.

The metrics you set in this step will usually be due dates and productivity levels, which you can track with systems like Kanban boards, Gantt charts, or burndown charts.

**What to include:**
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: What you'll measure
- **Success metrics**: How you'll know you've succeeded
- **Tracking methodology**: How you'll measure progress

**Example:**
> **Metrics for Success:**
> - **Goal 1: Integrate with all major ebook applications**
>   - Metric: Receive no customer comments on missing integrations in first month
> 
> - **Goal 2: Create the leading app of its kind**
>   - Metric: Reach #1 in productivity category on app stores
> 
> - **Goal 3: Ensure accurate understanding of user reading preferences**
>   - Metric: Maintain less than 5% error rate in reading preference tracking

## Best Practices for Writing PRDs

Now that you know the steps, here are some best practices to make your PRD even better:

### Be Specific and Measurable

Replace vague terms like "fast" or "user-friendly" with measurable criteria. Instead of "the app should be fast," say "the app should load in under 2 seconds on 4G connections."

### Use Active Voice

Write "The system validates the email" instead of "The email is validated by the system." Active voice is clearer and more direct.

### Number Your Requirements

Make requirements easy to reference. Use a system like REQ-001, REQ-002, or organize by feature area (AUTH-001, SYNC-001).

### Avoid Implementation Details

Focus on WHAT needs to be built, not HOW it should be built. Leave technical implementation to your engineering team unless it's critical to the requirement.

### Write for Multiple Audiences

Your PRD will be read by engineers, designers, executives, QA, and stakeholders. Make sure it's accessible to all of them. Use clear language and avoid unnecessary jargon.

### Include Visual Aids

Tables, diagrams, and flowcharts enhance clarity. A user flow diagram can communicate more than paragraphs of text.

### Version Control

Include a version number and change log. PRDs evolve, and you need to track changes. Document who changed what and when.

### Start with "Why" Before "What"

Always explain the reasoning behind requirements. When people understand why something is needed, they're more likely to build it correctly.

### Use User Stories

Format requirements as user stories: "As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]." This keeps the focus on user value.

### Prioritize Ruthlessly

Use frameworks like MoSCoW (Must, Should, Could, Won't) to prioritize. Not everything can be must-have.

### Include Acceptance Criteria

For each major requirement, define what "done" looks like. This prevents ambiguity and scope creep.

### Call Out Assumptions Explicitly

Don't hide assumptions. Make them visible so the team can validate or challenge them.

### Keep It Living

PRDs evolve. Don't treat them as set in stone. Update them as you learn more, but track those changes.

### Make It Scannable

Use clear headers, bullet points, and formatting. People should be able to find what they need quickly.

### Link to Supporting Documents

Rather than duplicating content, link to research documents, design mockups, and technical specs.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Being Too Vague**
- Bad: "The app should be user-friendly"
- Good: "New users should be able to complete onboarding in under 3 minutes with zero help"

**Including Implementation Details**
- Bad: "Use React with TypeScript and deploy on AWS"
- Good: "The interface should be responsive and support real-time updates"

**Forgetting the User**
- Bad: "Add a database table for user preferences"
- Good: "Users should be able to customize their reading preferences"

**No Prioritization**
- Bad: Listing 50 features with no indication of importance
- Good: Clearly marking must-haves vs. nice-to-haves

**Not Updating the PRD**
- Bad: Writing it once and never touching it again
- Good: Keeping it as a living document that evolves with the project

**Too Much Detail Too Early**
- Bad: Specifying every button placement in the first version
- Good: Defining core flows first, details come later

## How PRDs Fit Into Your Workflow


![banner](./marketreserachimages/p3.png)

A PRD is typically created after you've done your research (market research and user research from Module 1) but before development begins. Here's how it fits:

1. **Research Phase** (Module 1)
   - Market research → understand the competitive landscape
   - User research → understand user needs and pain points

2. **Planning Phase** (Module 2)
   - PRD creation → synthesize research into requirements
   - This is where you are now!

3. **Design Phase**
   - Designers use the PRD to create mockups and user flows

4. **Development Phase**
   - Engineers use the PRD to understand what to build
   - QA uses it to write test cases

5. **Launch Phase**
   - Use PRD success metrics to measure launch success
