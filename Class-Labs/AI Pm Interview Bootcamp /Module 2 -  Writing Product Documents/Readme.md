# Module 2: Writing Product Documents

![banner](./marketreserachimages/bn1.png)

Welcome to Module 2! This module is all about teaching you how to write essential product documents as a Product Manager. You'll learn how to use Claude Code as an AI-powered assistant to create Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) and Design Documents that clearly communicate your product vision and technical approach.

---

## Module Overview

As a Product Manager, documentation is how you translate your product vision into actionable plans. Module 2 focuses on teaching you how to write two critical documents that every PM needs to master:

- **Product Requirements Documents (PRD)** — Defining what to build and why
- **Design Documents** — Defining how to build it

Instead of spending days writing these documents manually, you'll learn how to use Claude Code as an **AI-powered documentation assistant**, enabling you to create professional, comprehensive documents in minutes instead of hours.
