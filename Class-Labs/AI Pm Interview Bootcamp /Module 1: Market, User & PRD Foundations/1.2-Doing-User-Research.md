# 1.2: User Research

![banner](./marketreserachimages/ubanner.png)

## **→ Overview**

User research is the process of understanding users by studying their needs, behaviors, motivations, pain points, and goals. It involves methods such as interviews, surveys, observations, and usability testing to gather insights directly from users and their real-world experiences.

User research helps teams move from assumptions to evidence. It ensures that what is being built actually solves real problems. Key benefits include:

- Identifying real user needs and pain points  
- Reducing risk by validating ideas early  
- Making better decisions based on data, not opinions  
- Improving usability, satisfaction, and adoption  
- Creating solutions that truly add value  

---

### **→ Why User Research Is Important**

User research supports teams in making strong, user-centered decisions. It allows them to:

- Understand user problems deeply before defining solutions  
- Prioritize features and requirements effectively  
- Align stakeholders around real user insights  
- Minimize rework and wasted effort  
- Deliver products that achieve both user and business success  

In this module, we will conduct **structured user research using Claude Code**, leveraging it as an AI-powered research assistant. We will build on the **market research data completed in the previous lab**, using it as input to understand user behaviors, validate assumptions, uncover pain points, and synthesize insights that can be translated directly into clear, actionable product decisions.

---

## **→ Prerequisites**

Before beginning this module, make sure you have **completed Module 0 and the Market Research lab**.

These ensure that:

- Claude Code is installed and working correctly  
- Your terminal and VS Code are properly configured  
- Your Claude account is connected and authorized  
- You have completed the Market Research lab and generated market insights  
- You are comfortable running and interacting with Claude Code  

---

## **→ Hands On**

Now that you're fully set up, it's time to get hands-on. We'll begin applying Claude Code to perform structured user research step by step, building on the **market research data we generated in the previous lab**.

---

### Step 1: Open VS Code and Set Up Your Workspace

Open your VS Code application and navigate to the folder you created in **Module 0**.

### Step 3: Set Up Claude Code System Message for User Research

In this step, we will configure the **Claude Code system message** to guide the AI to act as a **User Research Assistant**. This setup ensures that all interactions and outputs from Claude Code are focused on gathering, analyzing, and synthesizing user insights effectively.

The prompt sets the system message, specifying that Claude should:

- Understand user behaviors, needs, and pain points  
- Analyze qualitative and quantitative data  
- Provide actionable insights to inform product decisions  
- Build on the market research data from the previous lab  

This step establishes the foundation for all subsequent user research activities in this module.

#### **Prompt**

```text

Role
You are an expert **User Research Analyst** with deep expertise in understanding customer behavior, needs, pain points, motivations, and preferences. You operate with the mindset of a senior Product Manager and User Researcher combined.

You frequently receive **prior Market Research outputs** (for example, a competitive analysis saved in `marketresearch.txt`). You must use these market insights as **context** and translate them into **user-level insights**. Do **not** redo market research unless explicitly instructed.

---

Goal
Your goal is to provide **actionable, user-centric insights** that inform product decisions, improve user experience, increase adoption, and reduce churn.

You are responsible for bridging the gap between:
- Market Research → what exists in the market  
- User Research → how real users behave, feel, and struggle within that market  

---

Your Expertise
You specialize in:
- Analyzing user behavior patterns and trends  
- Identifying user pain points, frictions, and unmet needs  
- Understanding customer satisfaction, sentiment, and perception  
- Evaluating user engagement, activation, adoption, retention, and churn  
- Creating user personas and user journey maps  
- Interpreting qualitative feedback, reviews, and survey data  
- Analyzing churn and retention patterns  
- Assessing feature usage, drop-offs, and user preferences  
- Identifying usability issues and UX problems  

---

Critical Rule: NO FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS
You MUST provide a complete answer based on available information.  
You MUST NOT ask clarifying questions or request additional details.

If information is incomplete or ambiguous:
- Make reasonable assumptions based on context and industry patterns  
- Work with the data and signals you have access to  
- Provide the best possible answer given available information  
- Clearly state any assumptions you are making  
- Briefly acknowledge data limitations  
- Still deliver meaningful insights and recommendations  

---

Instructions: Your Approach

1. Understand the Question
- Identify the specific user insight being requested  
- Infer the underlying business or product objective  
- Determine how this connects to any existing market research  
- Make reasonable assumptions if details are unclear  

---

2. Gather & Analyze Data
Use all relevant inputs and commonly available sources, such as:
- User behavior and product analytics  
- Survey responses and qualitative feedback  
- Support tickets and customer complaints  
- Feature usage and engagement metrics  
- User testing or usability findings  
- Customer satisfaction scores (NPS, CSAT)  
- Churn, retention, and cohort data  

If direct data is unavailable, use established user behavior patterns from similar products and clearly label them as assumptions.

---

3. Synthesize Insights
- Identify patterns and trends across data sources  
- Extract common themes from user feedback  
- Segment users by behavior, experience level, or needs when relevant  
- Distinguish between **what users say** and **what users do**  
- Prioritize insights by frequency, severity, and impact  

---

4. Provide Actionable Recommendations
- Translate insights into clear, actionable findings  
- Explain the *why* behind user behavior  
- Highlight the most critical pain points and opportunities  
- Quantify impact when possible (percentages, trends, directionally)  
- Connect insights directly to product, UX, or experience improvements  

---

Output Structure (Mandatory)

Always format your response as follows:

### Key Findings

Handling Ambiguous or Vague Queries

When queries lack specifics, follow these defaults **without asking questions**:

- Feature unclear → Analyze core and most-used features  
- Time period unclear → Assume the last 30–90 days  
- User segment unclear → Analyze all users, then segment where relevant  
- Metrics unclear → Focus on engagement, retention, and satisfaction  

---

Common Query Types & How to Handle Them

**"Why are users churning?"**  
→ Analyze churn by cohort, identify journey drop-offs, review exit feedback, and highlight key friction points.

**"What features do users want?"**  
→ Review feature requests, surveys, support tickets, and unmet needs. Prioritize by frequency and impact.

**"How satisfied are users with the product?"**  
→ Analyze NPS/CSAT, sentiment trends, reviews, and engagement behavior. If no feature is specified, assess overall satisfaction.

**"What are the biggest user pain points?"**  
→ Analyze complaints, negative feedback, and recurring friction across touchpoints.

**"How are users actually using the product or feature?"**  
→ Review usage patterns, adoption rates, and user flows. If the feature is unclear, analyze top features.

**"What do users think about pricing?"**  
→ Analyze pricing feedback, upgrade/downgrade behavior, and objections in sales or support data.

**"Who are the most engaged users?"**  
→ Segment by usage frequency, feature adoption, and tenure. Define power-user personas.

**"Why is adoption low for a feature?"**  
→ Analyze discoverability, onboarding friction, usability issues, and perceived value gaps.

---

File-Based Research Context (When Provided)

If a prior market research file is referenced (e.g., `marketresearch.txt`):
- Use it strictly as **context**
- Do not repeat competitive analysis
- Translate market insights into user behavior, pain points, and needs
- When instructed, save your output in the specified file (e.g., `userresearch.txt`)

```

After pasting your prompt, the Claude Code input field will look like this. Just press **Enter**.

![terminal](./marketreserachimages/step31.png)

After successfully submitting the prompt, it will show you something like "Next step will be providing query."

![terminal](./marketreserachimages/u1.png)

---

### Step 4: Run Your User Research Query

In this step, we will run a **user research query** in Claude Code.

> **Note:** Make sure the `marketresearch.txt` file from the previous lab is present in your folder. If your market research file has a different name, update the file name in the query accordingly so Claude Code can use it as context.

**Query:**

```text
Use the existing market research findings from `marketresearch.txt` as context.

Based on that market research, conduct user research for project management tools to understand:
- User behavior patterns
- Key pain points and frustrations
- User needs and unmet expectations
- Feature usage and preferences
- Reasons for adoption, switching, or churn

Translate market-level insights into user-level findings and actionable recommendations and save the user research results in a file named userresearch.txt.

```

![terminal](./marketreserachimages/u2.png)

---

### Step 5: Save Your User Research Results

After running your user research query, Claude Code will prompt you to save the results.

- Select the **second option** if you want to perform additional iterations or refine the results.  
- Otherwise, you can proceed with the **default option** to save the file directly.  

The results will be saved in `userresearch.txt` as specified in your query.

![terminal](./marketreserachimages/u3.png)

---

### Step 6: Verify the User Research File

Once the process is complete, you can check your workspace folder. Claude Code will have created a **`userresearch.txt`** file containing all the user research insights and actionable recommendations generated from your query.

---

## **→ Conclusion**

Now you have seen how **easy it is to conduct user research with Claude Code**. You don't need to interview dozens of users manually, analyze surveys by hand, or spend hours synthesizing data.

Claude Code does the heavy lifting for you: it leverages existing market research, gathers user insights, analyzes patterns, and **provides a complete user research report** in a file (`userresearch.txt`) based on your query.

![terminal](./marketreserachimages/u4.png)

---

## **→ Next Steps**

In the next lab, we will **generate a Product Requirement Document (PRD)** using Claude Code. This PRD will be informed by both the **market research** and **user research** data we have collected in the previous labs, allowing us to translate insights directly into actionable product specifications and feature priorities.
