# Module 1: Market, User & PRD Foundations

![banner](./marketreserachimages/banner.png)

Welcome to Module 1! This module introduces the three core foundations of product development: **Market Research**, **User Research**, and **Product Requirements Documents (PRD)**. You'll learn how to use Claude Code as an AI-powered assistant to conduct research, analyze insights, and create structured product documentation.

## Module Overview

Before building any product, feature, or startup idea, it's critical to understand **what problem you are solving**, **who you are solving it for**, and **how the solution should be defined**. This module focuses on **thinking, researching, and defining** products in a structured way using Claude Code.

Instead of working manually, you'll learn how to use Claude Code as an **AI-powered product and research assistant**, guiding you step by step through the entire discovery process.

### [1.0 Context & Objective](./1.0-Context-and-Objective.md)

**Overview:**  
This is your starting point for Module 1. The context document explains why market research, user research, and PRDs are essential foundations before building any product. It sets the stage for understanding how these three components work together to create evidence-based product decisions.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Why market research matters for validating market opportunities
- Why user research is critical for understanding real user needs
- How PRDs bridge the gap between research and execution
- How Claude Code will help you perform all these steps efficiently

**Key Takeaway:** This module establishes the foundation for evidence-based product development using AI-powered tools.

### [1.3 Writing PRD](./1.3-Writing-PRD.md)

**Overview:**  
Synthesize your market and user research into a structured Product Requirements Document. This final lab teaches you to use Claude Code to generate a professional PRD that clearly defines product objectives, user needs, features, and success metrics.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to set up Claude Code as a PRD Author
- How to structure a comprehensive PRD
- How to leverage market and user research data
- How to define requirements, user stories, and success metrics
