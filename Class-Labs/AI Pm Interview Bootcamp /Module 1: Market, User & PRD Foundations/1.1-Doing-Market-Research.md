## **→ 1.1: Market Research**
![banner](./marketreserachimages/mrbanner.png)

### **→ Overview**

Market research is the foundation of strong product decisions. Whether you are building a new product or introducing a differentiated service, market research enables you to move from assumptions to **evidence-based strategy**.

Market research is not just about understanding the market size—it is about gaining **actionable intelligence** that informs product discovery, roadmap prioritization, pricing, positioning, and go-to-market decisions. Without this data, teams risk building solutions that lack demand, differentiation, or long-term viability.

Market research helps answer critical strategic questions such as:
- Is this a real market opportunity worth pursuing?
- Who are the target customers and how are they segmented?
- What solutions already exist, and where do they fall short?
- What competitive advantages or barriers to entry exist?
- How mature is the market, and where is it heading?

By systematically analyzing the competitive landscape, market dynamics, and customer demand, market research reduces uncertainty and prevents costly missteps. It allows product teams to identify opportunities, validate assumptions early, and align product strategy with real market needs.

### **→ What Is Market Research?**

Market research is the structured process of **collecting, analyzing, and synthesizing data** about a market, its participants, and the demand for a product or service. It is commonly used during the discovery phase to evaluate the feasibility and potential impact of a product idea.

Effective market research provides insights into:
- Market size and growth potential  
- Competitive positioning and differentiation  
- Customer segments and unmet needs  
- Pricing benchmarks and monetization models  
- Market trends, technologies, and regulatory factors  

These insights allow product teams to refine their solution, while enabling marketing and go-to-market teams to develop accurate buyer personas, messaging, and distribution strategies.

### **→ Why Market Research Matters for Product Managers**

Market research directly supports key product decisions, including:
- **Product-market fit validation**
- **Feature prioritization and differentiation**
- **Pricing and packaging strategy**
- **Market entry and expansion decisions**
- **Go-to-market planning**

It enables advanced techniques such as market segmentation, demand forecasting, and competitive benchmarking. As a result, teams are better positioned to create market awareness, drive adoption, and improve return on investment (ROI).

---

### **→ Key Areas Covered in Market Research**

A comprehensive market research process typically analyzes:

- Overall demand for the product or service  
- Total market size and addressable segments  
- Economic strength and buying power of target customers  
- Customer demographics and behavioral patterns  
- Availability, pricing, and positioning of competing solutions  

Understanding these dimensions allows Product Managers to assess the **overall viability** of an opportunity and make confident, data-driven decisions.

# Handling Ambiguous or Vague Queries

When queries lack specifics, use this approach:

**Instead of asking:** "Which market segment?"
**Do this:** Analyze the overall market and break down by major segments, highlighting the most attractive ones

**Instead of asking:** "Which competitors?"
**Do this:** Research and identify top 3-5 relevant competitors in the space

**Instead of asking:** "Which geographic region?"
**Do this:** Default to global market with breakdown by major regions (North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific) if relevant

**Instead of asking:** "What's your product category?"
**Do this:** Infer from context or analyze the broader category space

**Instead of asking:** "What time horizon for trends?"
**Do this:** Provide short-term (1-2 years) and long-term (3-5 years) perspectives

# Tools You Have Access To

- Web Search (for real-time market information)

```

After pasting your prompt, the Claude Code input field will look like this. Just press **Enter**.

![terminal](./marketreserachimages/step31.png)

After successfully submitting the prompt, it will show you something like "Next step will be providing query."

![terminal](./marketreserachimages/step4.png)

### Step 4: Run Your Market Research Query

Now, run the following query in Claude Code:

```text
Conduct market research on the competitive landscape for project management tools and save the results in a file named `marketresearch.txt`.
```
![terminal](./marketreserachimages/step41.png)

---

### Step 5: Enable Web Search in Claude Code

If Claude asks whether you want to use the **Web Search tool**, follow these steps:
- Use the **Down Arrow key** on your keyboard to select the **second option**

- Press **Enter** to confirm your selection.  

This will allow Claude Code to access the web and gather real-time information for your market research.

![terminal](./marketreserachimages/tool.png)

---

### Step 6: Store the Market Research Output

After Claude completes the execution, it will ask whether you want to:

- Store the result in `marketresearch.txt`  
- Or iterate on it again (select the third option if you want to refine)

![terminal](./marketreserachimages/file.png)

If you are satisfied with the output, just **select the default “Yes” option** and press **Enter**.  

This will save the market research results in the `marketresearch.txt` file in your project folder.

![terminal](./marketreserachimages/result.png)

### **→ Conclusion**

Now you have seen how **easy it is to conduct market research with just one query**. You don’t need to open Chrome, read multiple articles, or manually analyze all the data.  

Claude Code does the heavy lifting for you: it gathers information, analyzes it, and **provides a complete market research report** in a file (`marketresearch.txt`) based on your query.
