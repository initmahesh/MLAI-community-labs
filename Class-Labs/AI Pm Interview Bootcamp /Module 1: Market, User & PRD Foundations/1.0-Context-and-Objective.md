## **→ 1.0: Context & Objective**

![banner](./marketreserachimages/banner.png)

### **→ Overview**

Before building any product, feature, or startup idea, it is critical to understand **what problem you are solving**, **who you are solving it for**, and **how the solution should be defined**.

In this module, we will introduce three core foundations of product development:

- Market Research  
- User Research  
- Product Requirements Document (PRD)  

This module sets the context for everything that follows. Instead of jumping straight into building, we will first focus on **thinking, researching, and defining** the product in a structured way.

### **→ Why We Need Market Research**

Market research helps us understand the **bigger picture**.

It answers questions such as:
- Is this problem worth solving?
- How big is the market?
- What solutions already exist?
- What trends or gaps can we leverage?

Without market research, products are often built on assumptions. This can lead to building something that users don’t need or that already exists in a better form. Market research reduces risk and helps us validate whether an idea has real potential.

### **→ Why User Research Is Important**

Market research tells us **what exists**, but user research tells us **what people actually need**.

User research helps us:
- Understand user pain points and motivations  
- Learn how users currently solve the problem  
- Identify unmet needs and frustrations  
- Design solutions that are truly user-centric  

Without user research, even a good market opportunity can fail because the product does not align with real user behavior or expectations.

### **→ Why PRD (Product Requirements Document) Matters**

A PRD is the bridge between **research and execution**.

It clearly defines:
- The problem statement  
- Target users  
- Goals and success metrics  
- Key features and requirements  
- Constraints and assumptions  

A well-written PRD ensures that everyone involved—designers, developers, and stakeholders—has a shared understanding of what needs to be built and why.

### **→ How We Will Do This Using Claude Code**

In this module, we will perform **all of the above steps using Claude Code**.

Claude Code will help us:
- Conduct structured market research  
- Analyze user needs and pain points  
- Organize insights clearly  
- Convert research into a well-defined PRD  

Instead of working manually, you will learn how to use Claude Code as an **AI-powered product and research assistant**, guiding you step by step through the entire discovery process.
