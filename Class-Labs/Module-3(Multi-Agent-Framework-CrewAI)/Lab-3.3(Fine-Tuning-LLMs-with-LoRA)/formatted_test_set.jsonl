{"role": "assistant", "content": " Based on my analysis of the Master Service Agreement agreement, the late payment penalties or fees charged to customers are as follows:\n\n1. Past due amounts bear interest at 1.5% per month or the highest rate allowed by law (whichever is less). This means that if a customer fails to make a payment on time, they will be charged interest on the outstanding amount.\n\n2. Lumen may charge the customer reasonable attorneys' fees and any third-party collection costs incurred in collecting past due amounts. This implies that if Lumen has to take legal action or engage third-party collection agencies to recover unpaid amounts, the customer will be responsible for covering these additional costs.\n\nIt is important to note that the Master Service Agreement agreement does not provide specific details about the exact late payment penalties or fees charged to customers. However, the mentioned provisions indicate that interest charges and additional costs may be imposed in case of late payments."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " 30 days\n\nThe question asks for the amount of notice required by the service provider to give to the customer before increasing the price of the service. To find the answer, I analyzed the provided Master Service Agreement (MSA) content for any clauses that discuss changes in service fees or price adjustments.\n\nUpon reviewing the content, I found the relevant provision on 'page_number': 6, under the section titled '4. Services Fees; Taxes'. Specifically, 'content': '4.1 Services Fees. The Fees are stated on the Stripe Pricing Page, unless you and Stripe otherwise agree in writing. Stripe may revise the Fees at any time. If Stripe revises the Fees for a Service that you are currently using, Stripe will notify you at least 30 days before the revised Fees apply to you.'\n\nThis clause clearly states that if there is a revision in the fees for a service currently being used by the customer, the service provider (in this case, Stripe) is obligated to notify the customer at least 30 days before the revised fees take effect. Therefore, the MSA requires a 30-day notice period for the service provider to increase the price of the service.\n\nThe thought process involved identifying the section of the MSA that pertains to service fees, as this would logically be where any provisions regarding price increases would be found. Upon locating the relevant section, it was a matter of reading the specific language used to determine the required notice period. The term \"revised Fees\" in the context of the agreement refers to an increase in prices, which aligns with the core meaning of the question."}

{"role": "user", "content": " Read the question properly and analyze the Master Service Agreement agreement on the basis of this question.\\    \n    Question:'''Does the MSA provide for automatic renewal of the services?  Please provide a yes or no answer if possible.'''"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": " Yes\n\nThe Master Service Agreement (MSA) does provide for automatic renewal of the services. This is explicitly stated in the content provided from page 5 of the MSA, which reads: \"The contract renews automatically after 6 months.\" This clause indicates that upon the expiration of the initial term set forth on the Sales Order, the contract will renew itself for another term unless earlier terminated by either party in accordance with the termination provisions of the agreement.\n\nThe thought process behind this answer involves identifying the key term \"automatic renewal\" from the question and locating any relevant provisions within the MSA that address the renewal of services. The term \"automatic renewal\" typically refers to a contractual clause that allows for the continuation of services or the extension of a contract term without the need for manual re-signing or express consent from the parties at the time of renewal. In this case, the MSA explicitly states that the contract renews automatically, which directly answers the question posed.\n\nIt is important to note that the automatic renewal clause is subject to any rights of termination that the parties may have under the agreement. The MSA also outlines the circumstances under which either party may terminate the agreement, such as material breach that remains uncured, as mentioned in the termination subsection on page 5. However, in the absence of such termination, the services will renew automatically as per the terms of the MSA."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " The name of the service provider in the Master Service Agreement is \"Celonis.\"\n\nTo determine the name of the service provider, I analyzed the provided JSON-formatted Master Service Agreement agreement content. The term \"service provider\" typically refers to the entity that is providing services under the agreement. In the context of a Master Service Agreement, this would be the company that offers the services outlined in the agreement to another party, often referred to as the \"customer\" or \"client.\"\n\nIn the provided content, there are several references to \"Celonis\" in various capacities. For instance, on page 18, it mentions \"Celonis SE, Germany\" and other Celonis entities in different countries as affiliates that may support the services. Additionally, on page 39, the agreement uses the terms \"We,\" \"Us,\" \"Our,\" or \"Celonis\" to refer to the Celonis entity entering into the applicable order with the customer. This is further supported by the content on page 40, which defines \"You\" or \"Your\" as the company or other legal entity that enters into the applicable order with Celonis.\n\nFurthermore, on page 9, the agreement refers to the \"Service Level Agreement for Celonis Software-as-a-Service Offerings\" available on the Celonis website, which implies that Celonis is the provider of the Cloud Service and related offerings.\n\nBased on these references, it is clear that the service provider referred to in the Master Service Agreement is Celonis. The agreement does not directly state \"the name of the service provider is Celonis,\" but by analyzing the content and understanding the context in which the company Celonis is mentioned, it can be inferred that Celonis is the service provider in this agreement."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " Yes\n\nThe Master Service Agreement (MSA) provided includes an indemnification clause under which the customer indemnifies the service provider. This is evident from the content on page 14 and page 15 of the MSA.\n\nOn page 14, under section 11.2 titled \"User Indemnification,\" it states, \"You will defend the Stripe Parties against any Claim made against any of the Stripe Parties to the extent arising out of or relating to: (i) your breach of any of your representations, warranties or obligations under this Agreement; (ii) your use of the Services, including use of Personal Data; (iii) an allegation that any of the Marks you license to Stripe, or your Content, infringes on or misappropriates the rights, including IP Rights, of the third party making the Claim; or (iv) a User Party\u2019s negligence, willful misconduct or fraud.\"\n\nFurthermore, on page 15, under the same section (11.2), it continues with \"(b) Indemnification. You will indemnify the Stripe Parties against all Stripe Losses arising out of or relating to Claims described in this Section 11.2.\"\n\nThe language used in these sections clearly indicates that the customer (referred to as \"You\") is required to defend and indemnify the service provider (referred to as \"Stripe Parties\") against certain types of claims and losses. This obligation includes claims arising from the customer's breach of the agreement, use of the services, infringement claims related to the customer's content or marks, and the customer's negligence or misconduct.\n\nThe indemnification clause is a common provision in MSAs that allocates risk between the parties. In this case, the customer is taking on the responsibility to protect the service provider from certain legal claims and associated losses, which is a form of indemnification.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis of the relevant sections of the MSA, the answer to whether the MSA includes an indemnification clause under which the customer indemnifies the service provider is \"yes.\""}

If so then What are the intellectual property rights for customer in this agreement?'''"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": " Yes, the MSA does include provisions regarding the intellectual property rights owned by the customer. The relevant sections of the MSA that address intellectual property rights, specifically those owned by the customer, are as follows:\n\n1. Section 1.8 defines \"Customer Content\" as any content that is uploaded onto the Services by Customer or otherwise used on or in connection with the Software. This implies that the customer retains ownership of the content they contribute to the services.\n\n2. Section 3.2 states that the Services (excluding the Customer Content and Integration Partners data hosted thereon), Software, and all other materials provided by Expel, including all Intellectual Property Rights in each of the foregoing, are the exclusive property of Expel. This explicitly excludes Customer Content from the materials that Expel claims ownership over, thereby recognizing the customer's ownership of their intellectual property.\n\n3. Section 3.3 provides that Expel will create and make available to Customer security incident and other related reports (\"Reports\"). While the Report template and related Intellectual Property Rights remain the property of Expel, this does not extend to the Customer Content within those reports, which would be owned by the customer.\n\n4. Section 5.3 further emphasizes the customer's responsibility for the Customer Content, including all changes to and/or deletions of Customer Content and the security of all passwords and other Access Protocols required to access the Services. This responsibility implies ownership and control over the intellectual property rights of the Customer Content.\n\nFrom these sections, it can be inferred that the intellectual property rights for the customer in this agreement pertain to the \"Customer Content\" they upload or use in connection with the Software. The customer retains ownership of this content, and Expel recognizes this ownership by excluding Customer Content from the materials over which Expel claims exclusive rights.\n\nThe thought process involved in generating this answer included identifying the relevant sections of the MSA that discuss intellectual property rights, understanding the distinction made between Expel's property and Customer Content, and recognizing the implications of the customer's responsibilities for their content as outlined in the agreement. The core meaning of the question was to determine whether the customer's intellectual property rights were acknowledged and protected under the MSA, and the analysis of the agreement's content confirms that they are."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " Yes, the MSA does include a limitation of liability clause. The relevant content is found on page 5 and page 6 of the Master Service Agreement.\n\nThe clause on page 5 under section 8.5 states that, except in connection with a party's gross negligence or willful misconduct, indemnity obligations, violation of representations or warranties, or confidentiality obligations, neither party will be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages arising from or relating to the agreement.\n\nFurther clarification on the specific amount to which liability is limited is provided on page 6, where it states that the aggregate liability of either party arising out of or related to the agreement shall not exceed the total amount paid or payable by the client under the order giving rise to the liability in the twelve (12) months preceding the first incident out of which the liability arose.\n\nTo synthesize the information from the agreement, the limitation of liability clause is designed to cap the financial responsibility of either party to the total amount paid or payable under the specific order that is the subject of the claim, and this is limited to the payments made in the twelve months prior to the incident that gave rise to the liability. This effectively limits the potential financial exposure of the parties under the agreement, providing a predictable and quantifiable risk for both parties involved."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " Yes\n\nThe Master Service Agreement (MSA) specifically requires the service provider to delete customer data upon termination of the MSA. This is explicitly stated in the content provided from page 9, which reads: \"X.5. Return of Customer Data For a period of 7 days after termination of this MSA, Customer Data remains stored in the Application Services. At the conclusion of the 7-day period, Adverity shall delete the Customer Data from the Application Services and shall destroy any corresponding documents under its control, except to the extent that Adverity is bound by law to continue storing such Customer Data.\"\n\nThe question asks whether the MSA requires the service provider to delete customer data upon request by the customer or upon termination of the MSA. The provided text from the MSA addresses the scenario of termination, ensuring that the service provider is obligated to delete the customer data after a specific period following the termination of the agreement. However, the text does not explicitly mention the deletion of data upon request by the customer outside the context of termination.\n\nMy thought process involved looking for terms related to \"customer data,\" \"deletion,\" \"termination,\" and \"request by customer\" within the provided content. The relevant section was found in the content from page 9, which directly addresses the obligation of the service provider to delete customer data upon termination. The absence of any mention of a requirement to delete data upon customer request outside of termination suggests that the MSA does not explicitly provide for such a scenario. However, the question's core meaning focuses on the deletion of data in relation to the termination of the MSA, to which the answer is clearly stated in the agreement."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " Yes\n\nThe Master Service Agreement (MSA) does require the service provider to delete customer data upon request by the customer or upon termination of the MSA. This is evidenced by the content provided on page 9, which states, \"Except to the extent required otherwise by Data Privacy Laws, PSP will, at the choice of Client, return to Client and/or securely destroy all Personal Data.\" This clause indicates that the service provider, referred to as PSP, is obligated to either return or destroy all Personal Data belonging to the client, based on the client's preference, unless there is a legal requirement that dictates otherwise.\n\nFurthermore, the agreement specifies that the deletion of the Client Personal Data shall also include deletion of backups and logs in which information could be contained. This is a clear indication that the service provider must not only delete the primary data sets but also any ancillary records that may contain the client's personal data.\n\nThe MSA also mentions that the service provider will inform the client if it is not able to return or delete the Personal Data, which implies that the default expectation is for the data to be returned or deleted unless prohibited by Data Privacy Laws.\n\nThe analysis of the agreement requires understanding the terms used and their implications. The term \"Personal Data\" is key here, and the agreement outlines specific actions regarding this data upon the termination of the agreement or at the client's request. The term \"PSP\" refers to the service provider, and the term \"Client\" refers to the customer. The agreement's language around data deletion is clear and provides for the deletion of data, including backups and logs, which is a comprehensive approach to data destruction.\n\nIn conclusion, the MSA does require the service provider to delete customer data upon request by the customer or upon termination of the MSA, subject to any overriding legal requirements."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " No\n\nThe Master Service Agreement (MSA) does not provide for automatic renewal of the services. This can be inferred from the content provided on page number 6, which explicitly states, \"This contract is non-renewal and will not renew after term ends.\" This sentence clearly indicates that there is no provision for the services to be automatically renewed once the initial term of the contract comes to an end.\n\nAdditionally, the content on page number 1 specifies that \"The Term of this Agreement will begin on the Effective Date and continue for a period of 4 months (the 'Initial Term').\" This establishes the duration of the agreement but does not mention any automatic renewal beyond this initial term.\n\nFurthermore, the content on page number 4 under section 5.1 titled \"Term and Termination\" states, \"The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date of the Order Form and will continue for the term set forth therein (the 'Term').\" Again, there is no mention of automatic renewal.\n\nThe analysis of the provided content from the MSA indicates that the parties have agreed to a fixed term for the services with no clause suggesting that the agreement will renew automatically. The explicit mention of the contract being \"non-renewal\" is a clear indication that the parties must actively agree to extend the services beyond the initial term if they wish to continue the relationship. Therefore, based on the information provided, the MSA does not include an automatic renewal clause."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " The name of the service provider in this agreement is \"Adverity Inc.\"\n\nIn the context of a Master Service Agreement (MSA), the term \"service provider\" refers to the party that is providing the services outlined in the agreement. The question asks for the name of the service provider in the agreement provided.\n\nTo determine the service provider's name, I analyzed the content of the MSA provided in JSON format. The term \"service provider\" is synonymous with terms such as \"Seller,\" \"Vendor,\" or \"Supplier\" in various contractual agreements. In this MSA, the term \"Adverity\" is mentioned multiple times in conjunction with the provision of services. For example, on page 1, the agreement states, \"THIS MASTER SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT (\u201cMSA\u201d) (in the version dated January 23, 2023) GOVERNS THE USE BY ANY PERSON OR ENTITY (\u201cCUSTOMER\u201d) OF THE APPLICATION SERVICES (AS DEFINED BELOW) PROVIDED BY ADVERITY INC. (\u201cADVERITY\u201d).\" This clearly identifies Adverity Inc. as the party providing the application services, which is the subject of the MSA.\n\nAdditionally, throughout the agreement, there are references to \"Customer\" and \"Adverity,\" indicating the two parties involved, with Adverity being the one providing the services. For instance, on page 2, it states, \"Adverity shall make the Application Services available to Customer pursuant to this MSA,\" further confirming that Adverity Inc. is the service provider.\n\nTherefore, by understanding the context and the way the agreement is structured, it is clear that the service provider referred to in the MSA is Adverity Inc."}
