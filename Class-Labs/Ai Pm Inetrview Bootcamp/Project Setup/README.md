# AI PM Interview Bootcamp - Project Repository

## Overview

This is the **project repository for the AI PM Interview Bootcamp**. You will download this repository first (in Module 1, Lesson 1.4) to set up the context and templates that will be used throughout the course.

This repository contains all the context files, templates, and sample prompts that you'll use to practice Product Management tasks with Claude Code, including market research, user research, and writing Product Requirements Documents (PRDs).

## What This Repository Contains

This project repository provides the foundation for all hands-on exercises in the bootcamp:

### Company Context Files (`company-context/`)

These files contain information about LegalGraph, a fictional AI-powered legal contract review platform. You'll use these as context when performing PM tasks:

- `company-overview.md` - Company background, team, metrics, strategy, OKRs
- `user-personas.md` - Three user personas: Jennifer (GC), David (Senior Counsel), Rachel (Legal Ops)
- `product-description.md` - Current product features, roadmap, tech stack
- `competitive-landscape.md` - Competitors and market positioning

### Templates (`templates/`)

Pre-defined output format templates that ensure consistency in your deliverables:

- `market-research-format.md` - Structure for market research deliverables
- `user-research-format.md` - Structure for user research deliverables
- `prd-template.md` - Structure for Product Requirements Documents

### Sample Prompts (`sampleprompts/`)

Ready-to-use example prompts for common PM tasks:

- `market-research-prompt.md` - Example prompt for conducting market research
- `user-research-prompt.md` - Example prompt for conducting user research
- `prd-prompt.md` - Example prompt for writing PRDs

### Configuration Files

- `CLAUDE.md` - Project-level instructions for Claude Code (defines context and workflows)
- `CLAUDE.local.md` - Personal customizations (not shared)
