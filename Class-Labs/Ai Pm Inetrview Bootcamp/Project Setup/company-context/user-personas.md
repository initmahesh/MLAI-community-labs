## Overview

---

## Persona 1: Jennifer (General Counsel)

### Quick Facts

**Name:** Jennifer Martinez
**Age:** 45
**Role:** General Counsel (GC)
**Company:** CloudScale (1,200 employees, Series D SaaS company)
**Location:** Boston, MA (hybrid, 3 days in office)
**LegalGraph Plan:** Enterprise
**Team size:** 8 attorneys, 2 paralegals, 1 legal ops specialist

### Background

Jennifer leads the legal department for a fast-growing enterprise SaaS company. She reports to the CEO and sits on the executive team. Responsible for all legal matters: contracts, compliance, litigation, employment law, IP.

**Career path:**

- GC at current company (5 years, grew team from 2 to 11)
- Bar admission: Massachusetts, New York

**Education:**
- BA in Economics (Harvard)
- JD (Columbia Law School)

### Goals & Motivations

**Primary goals:**
1. **Mitigate legal risk** - Protect company from lawsuits, compliance issues, bad contracts
2. **Enable business velocity** - Legal shouldn't be bottleneck, support deals closing fast
3. **Scale the team** - Do more with same headcount (CFO won't approve new hires)
4. **Executive credibility** - Be seen as strategic partner, not "department of no"

**Success metrics:**
- Contract turnaround time (5 days → 2 days)
- Legal cost as % of revenue (down)
- Risk incidents (zero material breaches)
- Business satisfaction with legal (NPS)
- Revenue supported per legal FTE

### Pain Points & Frustrations

**1. Volume is crushing the team**
- 500+ contracts per year (growing 30% annually)
- Each contract takes 3-5 hours of attorney time
- Team working nights and weekends
- CFO says "no" to hiring more lawyers
- Burnout risk is high

**2. Inconsistent contract review**
- Junior attorneys miss key risk clauses
- Different attorneys have different risk tolerances
- No standard playbook (it's in people's heads)
- Quality depends on who reviews
- Missed issues come back as problems later

**3. Can't report on risk exposure**
- CEO asks: "What's our liability exposure across all vendor contracts?"
- Takes 2 weeks to manually review 200 contracts
- By the time we have answer, it's out of date
- Portfolio-level visibility doesn't exist

**4. Legacy processes**
- Still using Word + email + spreadsheets
- Contracts lost in email threads
- Can't find signed agreements
- No audit trail ("who approved this?")
- Manual, error-prone

### Jobs to be Done

**When...**
- ...vendor sends MSA → Review quickly against playbook, identify deviations, approve or negotiate
- ...sales closes big deal → Fast-track contract review, don't block $500k deal
- ...audit happens → Produce all contracts and compliance evidence instantly
- ...CEO asks about risk → Provide portfolio-level risk analysis on demand
- ...training junior attorney → Codify institutional knowledge into playbook
- ...negotiating terms → Know what terms we've accepted elsewhere (precedent)

### LegalGraph Features They Care About

**Must-haves:**
- Risk scoring - Instant portfolio risk visibility
- Playbook management - Codify legal guidelines
- Deviation detection - Flag when contracts vary from standards
- Portfolio analytics - Executive dashboard for board meetings
- Audit trail - Who reviewed, approved, when, why

**Nice-to-haves:**
- Integration with DocuSign (e-signature)
- Integration with Salesforce (see contract status)
- Custom risk dimensions (IP, data privacy, liability)
- Benchmarking (how do our terms compare to market)

**Don't care about:**
- Fancy UI animations
- Mobile app (desktop role)
- Social features

### Behavior & Preferences

**How they work:**
- Strategic time: Board meetings, exec team, strategy (40%)
- Review time: High-risk contracts, complex negotiations (30%)
- Management time: 1:1s with team, training, hiring (20%)
- Admin time: Budget, vendor management, reporting (10%)
- Communication: Mix of meetings (strategic) and email (operational)

**Tech savviness:** Medium-high
- Comfortable with legal tech
- Not an engineer, but gets tech concepts
- Appreciates good UX (tired of clunky legal software)
- Delegates technical setup to legal ops specialist

**Buying process:**
- Does research (reads G2 reviews, asks GC peers)

- Legal reviews own contract (ironic but necessary)
- Pilot with 2-3 attorneys before full rollout
- Typical sales cycle: 2-3 months
- Budget: $30k-100k/year for legal tech

### Quotes

*"I need to scale my team's output without hiring. That means better processes and tools, not just more bodies."*

*"My CFO asks: 'Can we quantify our contract risk exposure?' I should be able to answer that in 5 minutes, not 2 weeks."*

*"Junior attorneys are expensive, and they make mistakes. I need a system that catches 90% of issues automatically so they focus on the hard 10%."*

*"Legal can't be the bottleneck. If sales wants to close a deal, we need to turn contracts around in days, not weeks."*

*"I want our institutional knowledge in a system, not locked in senior attorneys' heads. What happens when they leave?"*

### Goals & Motivations

**Primary goals:**
1. **Efficient contract review** - Turn around contracts fast without missing risks
2. **Protect the company** - Catch liability, IP, and compliance issues
3. **Train junior attorneys** - Develop team, delegate routine work

**Success metrics:**
- Contracts reviewed per week
- Turnaround time (SLA: 3 business days)
- Issues caught (before they become problems)

### Pain Points & Frustrations

### Jobs to be Done

**When...**
- ...new contract arrives → Triage urgency, identify contract type, apply playbook

- ...high-risk clause found → Escalate to GC with context and recommendation
- ...negotiating terms → See what terms we've accepted before (precedent)
- ...training junior attorney → Show them what to look for using AI-flagged examples
