## Module Overview

As a Product Manager, being able to build prototypes and working demos gives you a significant advantage. Module 3 focuses on teaching you how to leverage Claude Code to build functional applications, demonstrating that AI-powered development makes building accessible to product managers and non-technical professionals.

In this module, you'll learn to:

- **Build with Code** — Create real, working applications using Claude Code
- **Create Interactive Dashboards** — Build a dashboard that uploads CSV files and automatically generates visualizations
- **Iterate and Improve** — Learn how to refine and enhance your applications through iterative prompting

Instead of spending weeks waiting for engineering resources, you'll learn how to use Claude Code as an **AI-powered development assistant**, enabling you to create working prototypes and demos in minutes instead of days.
