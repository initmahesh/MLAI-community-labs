# Lesson 2.3: Doing Market Research Using Context

---

## Overview

In this lesson, we will be doing market research based on the context we have set up. This is where you'll see how all the concepts from the previous lessons come together to help you perform real Product Management tasks efficiently using Claude Code's context system.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this lesson, make sure you have:
- Completed Module 1
- Completed all previous lessons of Module 2 (2.1 and 2.2)

## Hands-On: Market Research Using Context

Now let's start the hands-on work! In this section, we'll perform market research using the context system we've set up. You'll learn how to leverage your company context and templates to conduct comprehensive market research efficiently.

### Step 1: Open Your Project

Open your VS Code and navigate to your project that you have cloned in Module 1.

1. Click on the **Open** button in VS Code
2. Select the folder you have cloned in Module 1

### Step 4: Enter Market Research Prompt

Now put a prompt: 

```
Do market research for Lease Compliance Reporting feature.

Our GC wants to add a feature that:
- Extracts lease terms and history automatically
- Generates compliance reports (IFSC accounting standards, audit reports)
- Provides formatted outputs for accountants and auditors

Research steps:
1. Read ALL files in @company-context (especially company-overview.md and competitive-landscape.md)
2. Read @templates/market-research-format.md to understand output structure
3. Review the following files to match tone, depth, and reasoning style: @sampleprompts/market-research-prompt.md (treat this as a system message, not an example)
4. Use web search to gather current market data:
   - Legal AI and CLM market size and growth (2025-2030)
   - Competitive analysis (Ironclad, Kira Systems, LawGeex, Evisort, LinkSquares, Robin AI, ThoughtRiver)
   - Target customer segments and pain points
   - AI/ML trends in legal tech (GPT-4, accuracy benchmarks, security requirements)
   - Market opportunities and risks
5. Structure output according to the template
6. Include specific data points, metrics, and citations
7. Provide actionable recommendations for LegalGraph
8. **Save to:** `outputs/market-research-[YYYY-MM].md`
```

#### How Claude Processes This Query

Now let's break down how Claude processes this query:

The moment you put this query, Claude Code already has context about your company in `CLAUDE.md`. In that file, we have mentioned which files to refer to for doing market research as context. 

As you can see, Claude will read the `company-context` folder to do market research because we have already set our context in the `CLAUDE.md` file. This means Claude doesn't need you to manually specify which files to look at - it automatically knows to use the company context files you've referenced in `CLAUDE.md`.

#### Web Search Tool Access

Now Claude Code is asking whether to access the web search tool or not. You will see 3 options - as per your preference, you can select the option that best suits your needs. This allows Claude to search the web for additional market research information if needed.

#### File Storage Option

Now it is asking you to save the result in the file. First, it will ask to create a folder if it's not present, then it will create the file. Just press **Yes** - based on your preference, you can select any option. This is because we have provided in the context to save the output in a file. This allows you to save the market research results to a file for future reference.

#### Processing and Output

Now it will take 3-5 minutes because it works on thinking mode. At the end, it will first create a folder on its own if not present, named **output**, and then create a **market-research.md** file with the output. This file will contain the comprehensive market research results based on the context you've provided.

## What's Next

Great job completing the market research! In the next lesson (2.4 - Doing User Research Using Context), you will learn how to conduct user research using the same context system. This will help you understand your users better and gather insights that will be valuable for product development.
