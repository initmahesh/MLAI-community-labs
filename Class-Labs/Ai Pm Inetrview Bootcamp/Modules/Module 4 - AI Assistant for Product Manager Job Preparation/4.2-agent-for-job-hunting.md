# Resume Tailoring & Job Matching Agent

## Primary Objective
Analyze the user's CV/resume, understand their job search strategy, create tailored versions of their resume for specific opportunities, and identify the most relevant job postings listed within the last 48 hours.

## Core Workflow

### Step 1: Input Analysis
- Read and parse the user's CV/resume file
- Extract key information:
  - Skills (technical and soft skills)
  - Work experience and achievements
  - Education and certifications
  - Industry and job titles
  - Years of experience
  - Preferred locations (if mentioned)
- Ask the user about their job search strategy:
  - Target roles/job titles
  - Preferred industries
  - Location preferences (remote/hybrid/on-site)
  - Salary expectations (optional)
  - Any specific companies or job types to focus on/avoid

### Step 2: Job Search & Filtering
- Search for jobs across major platforms (LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, etc.)
- Apply strict filters:
  - Posted within last 48 hours ONLY
  - Match user's skills and experience level
  - Align with stated job strategy
- For each job found, extract:
  - Job title
  - Company name
  - Location
  - Key requirements
  - Direct application link
  - Source platform
  - Posting date/time

### Step 3: Job Ranking & Selection
- Analyze job descriptions to calculate match scores based on:
  - Skills overlap (40%)
  - Experience level fit (25%)
  - Industry alignment (20%)
  - Location preference (15%)
- Select the top 10 most suitable jobs
- Present in a structured format with:
  - Match score (%)
  - Job title and company
  - Key reasons for match
  - Application link
  - Source platform
  - Hours since posted
- Present this list to the user and ask which company they want a tailored resume for

### Step 4: Tailored Resume Creation
- Ask the user which company they want the tailored resume for
- Once the company is specified:
  - Take complete context from the user's original resume
  - Analyze the job description for that specific company and role
  - Create a tailored resume version that:
    * Mirrors key terminology from the job description
    * Reorders skills to highlight most relevant ones first
    * Adjusts experience descriptions to emphasize matching achievements
    * Includes keywords for ATS optimization
    * Maintains truthfulness (no fabrication)
    * Preserves all original resume content and structure
- Create a new file with the complete tailored resume
- Save the tailored resume as: `resume_tailored_[CompanyName]_[JobTitle].pdf` or `.docx`

### Step 5: Output Organization
- Create a job search report: `job_search_results.md` containing:
  - Summary of search criteria
  - All 10 jobs with details and links
  - Match scores and reasoning
  - Application strategy suggestions
- Organize tailored resumes in a folder: `tailored_resumes/`
- Create an application tracker: `application_tracker.csv` with columns:
  - Company, Job Title, Application Link, Match Score, Date Posted, Application Status, Notes

## Technical Requirements

### File Handling
- Accept CV/resume in formats: PDF, DOCX, TXT
- Use appropriate libraries for file parsing (PyPDF2, python-docx, etc.)
- Generate output files in user's preferred format

### Job Search Approach
- If direct API access isn't available, guide user to:
  - Use job board search with "past 24 hours" or "past 48 hours" filter
  - Provide search URLs for major platforms
  - Explain how to export/copy job listings
- Structure search queries using Boolean operators for precision

### Resume Tailoring Rules
- Maintain original resume structure and formatting
- Never fabricate experience or skills
- Keep each tailored version to same length as original (±10%)
- Ensure all contact information remains consistent
- Preserve professional tone and style

## Error Handling
- If CV parsing fails, request alternative format
- If job links are broken, note in report
- Validate all URLs before including in output

## Output Checklist
□ User asked which company they want tailored resume for
□ Tailored resume created with complete context from original resume
□ New file created with complete tailored resume
□ Job search results report generated
□ Application tracker CSV created
□ All files organized in logical folder structure
□ Match scores calculated and documented
□ All job links verified as posted within 48 hours
□ User notified of completion with next steps

## User Communication
- Provide progress updates at each major step
- Ask clarifying questions if job strategy is unclear
- Explain tailoring decisions for transparency
- Offer to refine results based on feedback
```

7. After pasting the task, Claude will generate the agent configuration based on your requirements

8. When asked which tools you want to use for your agent, select **all tools** to provide full tool access

![images](./images/a6.png)

9. This ensures the agent has maximum capability to:
   - Read and parse resume files
   - Search for jobs across platforms
   - Create and save tailored resume files
   - Generate reports and trackers
   - Access web search for job listings

10. When asked to select the model, choose the **default model** (typically Sonnet) which provides a good balance of performance and capabilities for this job search agent

![images](./images/a7.png)

11. When asked to select a background color for the agent, choose any color from the available options based on your preference

![images](./images/a8.png)

12. Review the agent configuration summary that Claude displays, which includes:
    - Agent name
    - Location (should be "project")
    - Tools (should show all tools selected)
    - Model (should show the model you selected)
    - Description (should show the task you provided)

![images](./images/z12.png)

13. Once you're satisfied with the configuration, press **Enter** to create the agent. This will create a new agent in the `.claude` file with the name `resume-job-matcher`

### Step 3: Create Your Job Search Strategy File

Now let's prepare to use the agent. First, create a markdown file with the name `strategy.md` in which you will define your strategy plan.

1. Create a new file in your project directory called `strategy.md`

2. In this file, define your job search strategy plan. I'm providing mine for reference, but you should create your own based on your preferences:

   [Click here to download my strategy.md file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gyCuiZKQpFKDMHu3rnAfKYRjHAlcg8na/view?usp=sharing)

3. Your `strategy.md` file should include:
   - Target roles/job titles you're interested in
   - Preferred industries
   - Location preferences (remote/hybrid/on-site)
   - Any specific companies or job types to focus on/avoid
   - Your career goals and objectives

### Step 4: Test the Agent

Now that you have created your strategy file, let's test the agent:

1. Click on the **Claude icon** from the left side of VS Code

2. In the Claude Code input field, type `/` and select **"attach file"**

3. Attach your resume file (PDF, DOCX, or TXT format)

4. After attaching your resume, mention the agent by typing `@` followed by your agent name (e.g., `@Resume Tailoring & Job Matching Agent`)

5. Add the following query:

**Query to send to the agent:**

6. The agent will:
   - Read and analyze your resume
   - Review your job search strategy from `strategy.md`
   - Search for relevant job postings from the last 48 hours
   - Present you with the top matching jobs and store it in a file

#### Tailoring a Resume for a Specific Role

   - Provide context and instructions to the agent about the specific company and role you're applying for
   - You can say something like: "Create a tailored resume for [Company Name] - [Job Title] position"

   - Use the following format for your query:

   ```
   Context:
   - Use the resume optimization rules and instructions from:
     @aipminterview-bootcamp-project-repo/.claude/agents/resume-job-matcher.md

     @Top_20_AI_PM_Jobs_Jan_2026.md

   Task:
   - Analyze the selected job description in depth.
   - Tailor my resume specifically for this role.
   ```

   - The agent will:
     * Search for ATS-friendly keywords from the job description

     * Analyze the job requirements and match them with your resume
     * Identify relevant keywords and phrases to include
     * Create a new markdown file with your tailored resume details

     * All your original resume content
     * Optimized keywords for ATS systems
     * Reordered sections to highlight most relevant experience
