# How to Create Mocks and Visualizations

## Overview

Up until now, you have only learned about content creation and how to conduct research using AI agents. Now it's time to take the next step and build something tangible - **mocks and visualizations**.

In this lesson, we will build a **website for LegalGraph**. This hands-on exercise will teach you how to:

- Create visual mockups and prototypes
- Build interactive websites
- Develop professional-looking web interfaces that showcase your product ideas

This practical experience will help you move beyond just gathering information to actually creating visual representations of your concepts, which is essential for product managers who need to communicate ideas effectively to stakeholders, developers, and designers.

### Step 4: Claude Analyzes Context

1. Claude will first analyze the Claude markdown file (`.md` file) as it acts as context for all queries
2. This helps Claude understand the project context and previous work
3. Claude uses this information to create a website that aligns with your project

---

### Step 5: Claude Writes Code and Creates HTML File

1. Claude will write the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for your website
2. Claude will ask you to create a file with `.html` extension to save the code
3. You can name it something like `legalgraph-website.html` or `index.html`
4. Confirm the file creation when prompted

![images](./images/s2.png)

### Step 6: Code Saved to HTML File

1. Once you confirm, the complete website code will be stored in the `.html` extension file
2. The file will contain all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript needed for your website
3. You can view and edit this file in VS Code

---

### Step 7: View the Website

1. To see the website, open a **new terminal** in VS Code
2. Navigate to the directory where your HTML file is saved
3. Use the following command based on your operating system:

   **For Mac:**
