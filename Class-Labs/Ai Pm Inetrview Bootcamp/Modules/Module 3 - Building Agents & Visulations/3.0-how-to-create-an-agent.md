# How to Create an Agent

## Overview

### What Kind of Agent Are We Building?

We are building a **Competitive Intelligence Monitoring Agent** - an autonomous AI agent that continuously tracks and analyzes competitor activities in the legal tech space. This agent automates the labor-intensive process of competitive research by:

- **Monitoring multiple competitors simultaneously** (Ironclad, Kira Systems, LawGeex)
- **Gathering intelligence from diverse sources** including product announcements, pricing changes, funding news, customer reviews, and executive movements
- **Analyzing competitive threats and opportunities** to inform strategic decision-making
- **Generating actionable intelligence reports** with threat assessments and recommended actions

### Why This Agent Matters to Product Managers

For Product Managers, competitive intelligence is critical but time-consuming. This agent addresses key PM challenges:

1. **Time Efficiency**: Manually monitoring 3+ competitors across multiple channels (websites, review platforms, news sources) can take hours each week. This agent automates that process, freeing PMs to focus on strategy and execution.

2. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: The agent provides structured analysis with threat assessments (High/Medium/Low) and opportunity identification, enabling PMs to prioritize responses and resource allocation based on actual competitive dynamics.

3. **Strategic Advantage**: By identifying gaps in competitor offerings and emerging threats early, PMs can:
   - Adjust product roadmap priorities
   - Develop counter-strategies before competitors gain momentum
   - Position LegalGraph's unique value propositions more effectively
   - Make informed decisions about feature development and market positioning

4. **Consistency and Coverage**: Human monitoring is prone to missing updates or inconsistent tracking. The agent ensures comprehensive, systematic coverage of all specified intelligence sources on a regular cadence.

In essence, this agent transforms competitive intelligence from a reactive, ad-hoc activity into a proactive, systematic capability that keeps PMs informed and enables faster, more strategic responses to market changes.

### Step 7: Define the Agent Task

1. Claude will now ask you to define the task for your agent
2. You can customize the task description based on your needs, or use the following task for the competitive intelligence agent:


```
**Task: Create a competitive intelligence report for LegalGraph**

Monitor our 3 competitors (Ironclad, Kira Systems, LawGeex):

1. Search for updates in last 30 days:
   - Product announcements (new features, launches)
   - Pricing changes
   - Funding news
   - Customer reviews (G2, Capterra)
   - Executive moves (new hires, departures)

2. Analyze impact on LegalGraph:
   - Which updates threaten us?
   - Which gaps can we exploit?
   - What should we respond to?

3. Create competitive intelligence brief with:
   - Summary of key changes
   - Threat assessment (High/Medium/Low per competitor)
   - Opportunity identification
   - Recommended actions for LegalGraph

Save to: `outputs/competitive-intel-[date].md`

```

3. Paste or type this task description into Claude when prompted
4. You can modify this task description if you want to customize the agent's behavior

### Step 8: Select Tools for the Agent

1. Claude will now ask you which tools you want to use for your agent
2. Available tools may include:
   - **Web Search** - For searching the internet and gathering information
   - **Read Only** - For reading files and documents
   - And other tools based on your Claude setup
3. You can select any tools based on your preference
4. For this competitive intelligence agent, select **all tools** by default to ensure maximum capability
5. This allows the agent to perform web searches, read files, and utilize all available functionality
