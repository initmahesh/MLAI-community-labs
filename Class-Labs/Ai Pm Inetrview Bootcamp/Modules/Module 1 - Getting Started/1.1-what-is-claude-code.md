# What is Claude Code?

![claude](./images/claudecodebanner.png)

**Claude Code is a context-aware AI development tool that acts as an intelligent pair programming partner with complete visibility into your codebase**. Unlike traditional AI assistants that operate in isolation, Claude Code understands your entire project ecosystem—including file structures, dependencies, coding conventions, and project history. This deep contextual understanding enables it to deliver personalized, project-specific solutions that align with your team's existing architecture and coding standards, ultimately accelerating development velocity, reducing technical debt, and improving code quality across your product.

## How It Works

Claude Code uses advanced language models trained on vast amounts of code and documentation. What sets Claude Code apart is its **deep integration with your codebase and development environment**. 

When you interact with Claude Code, it has access to:
- **Your entire project context**: All files, folders, and code structure in your workspace
- **Your coding style**: Patterns, conventions, and preferences used throughout your codebase
- **Project dependencies**: Understanding of libraries, frameworks, and tools you're using
- **File relationships**: How different files and modules connect and interact with each other
- **Recent changes**: Awareness of what you've been working on and your current focus

This contextual awareness allows Claude Code to provide highly relevant, project-specific suggestions that align with your existing codebase, rather than generic responses.
