# Building a Secure Authentication System with V0 and Supabase

![into image](./images/imgop.jpeg)
## Overview

Imagine this:  

You’re an **AI Product Manager or Builder** working on a platform that delivers powerful AI-driven insights. But before users can interact with your application, you need a **secure way for them to register, log in, and manage sessions**.  

That’s exactly what this lab helps you build.  

You’ll design a **production-ready authentication system** that forms the foundation of any AI product — whether it’s a personalized dashboard, an AI assistant, or a data analytics portal.  

By the end of this lab, you’ll have:  

- A **Sign-Up Page** so new users can create accounts.  
- A **Login Page** so returning users can access their data.  
- **Secure Session Handling** powered by Supabase’s authentication.  
- A seamless integration between **V0.dev** (for building the UI) and **Supabase** (for managing auth + data).  
- A **Feedback Capture Flow** so users can share their thoughts directly in the app — helping you improve your product with real user insights.  

The best part? You’ll achieve all this **without writing complex backend code** — no dedicated infra, no DevOps headaches. Just you, your product vision, and AI.  


## What is Supabase ?
Supabase is an open-source, Firebase alternative that provides a suite of backend tools and services for building applications. It's essentially a Backend as a Service (BaaS) platform that simplifies backend development by offering features like a PostgreSQL database, authentication, file storage, and serverless functions, all in one place.

## Let’s Get Started


### Step 1: Access V0.dev
1. Open your browser and navigate to **[V0.dev](https://v0.app/)**.
2. This is where we’ll design and prototype our authentication interface without writing all the frontend code from scratch.
3. Make sure you’re logged in to your V0 account. If you don’t have one, create it — it’s free and only takes a minute.


### Step 2: Write Your Prompt in the V0 Chat Interface
1. Type or paste a clear, detailed prompt specifying the authentication system you want.
2. You can use the sample prompt below and modify it as needed:

> **Note:** Prompt may be not be optimal, Iterate and follow up a few times to get good results.

**Sample Prompt:**
```
Build a full-stack web app with the following functionality:  

### Part 1: Authentication (Supabase Integration)
- Create an authentication screen with two flows:  
  - **Registration Page**:  
    - Ask user for email + password.  
    - Store these credentials in Supabase Auth.  
  - **Login Page**:  
    - Authenticate the user using Supabase Auth with email + password.  
- Once registration and login are successful:  
  - Show a log message confirming success.  
  - Redirect the user to the landing page.  
- Provide an option for me to configure Supabase environment keys (hardcode them in the project after login).  

### Part 2: Landing Page (AI Competitor Analysis Tool)
- Create a clean, modern landing page with:  
  - Input fields for two company names.  
  - A settings tab (top-right) where users securely enter their **OpenAI API key**.  
- Use the **OpenAI SDK** (`createOpenAI` from `@ai-sdk/openai`) with the user’s API key (dynamically, per request — not hardcoded).  
- Send a structured prompt to the LLM instructing it to return **only raw JSON** (no markdown or wrappers).  
- Parse this JSON and display a concise, side-by-side comparison of the two companies in a **clean, structured table**.  

### Part 3: Feedback System
- Add a feedback section (1–5 stars).  
- Store feedback in Supabase, associated with the logged-in user.  

### Guardrails
- Ensure API calls dynamically use the user’s API key (never hardcode globally).  
- Configure the OpenAI client with `createOpenAI` inside the API route per request.  
- LLM must return only JSON (strict formatting).  
- Handle middleware properly — redirection should not depend on Supabase client alone.  
- Keep comparison concise, fact-based, and relevant.  
- UI should be clean, modern, and user-friendly.

![Blank Flow Selection](./images/img-12.png)
2. Here, you can configure the methods users will use to authenticate — for this lab.

### Step 12: Configure Sign-In Providers
1. Make sure to **disable** the **Confirm Email** option.  
   - By default, Supabase sends a verification email when a new user registers.  
   - For this lab, we don’t require email verification, so disabling this will allow immediate access after registration.

2. Click on the **Save Changes** button to apply your settings.

> **💡 Important Note:**  
> If you face any issue while authenticating **V0** with **Supabase**, don’t worry.  
> Sometimes there can be minor connection or configuration errors. In such cases:  
> - Simply ask **V0** to fix it via the chat interface.  
> - Or click on the **Try Fix** option in V0.  
> This usually resolves most integration issues automatically.
