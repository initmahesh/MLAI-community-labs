# Module 1: Introduction to AI Agents and No-Code Development

![](./images/banner.png)

Welcome to **Module 1** ! This module is designed to introduce you to the world of **AI agents**, **workflow automation**, and **no-code development tools**. You'll learn how to build intelligent applications without writing extensive code, leveraging powerful platforms like **n8n** and **v0.dev**.

---

## 🎯 Module Overview

In this module, you will:

- **Master Prompt Engineering** — Learn how to craft effective prompts that produce high-quality AI responses
- **Build Automated Workflows** — Create intelligent workflows in n8n that integrate with AI models
- **Develop Modern UIs** — Use v0.dev to rapidly prototype professional web interfaces
- **Connect Systems with Webhooks** — Integrate different platforms to create end-to-end solutions

By the end of this module, you'll have hands-on experience building three complete projects that demonstrate the power of AI-driven automation and no-code development.
