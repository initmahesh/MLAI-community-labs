# Module 1: Introduction to AI Agents and No-Code Development

![](./images/banner.png)

Welcome to **Module 1** ! This module is designed to introduce you to the world of **AI agents**, **workflow automation**, and **no-code development tools**. You'll learn how to build intelligent applications without writing extensive code, leveraging powerful platforms like **n8n** and **v0.dev**.

---

## üéØ Module Overview

In this module, you will:

- **Master Prompt Engineering** ‚Äî Learn how to craft effective prompts that produce high-quality AI responses
- **Build Automated Workflows** ‚Äî Create intelligent workflows in n8n that integrate with AI models
- **Develop Modern UIs** ‚Äî Use v0.dev to rapidly prototype professional web interfaces
- **Connect Systems with Webhooks** ‚Äî Integrate different platforms to create end-to-end solutions

By the end of this module, you'll have hands-on experience building three complete projects that demonstrate the power of AI-driven automation and no-code development.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before starting any lab in this module, ensure you have:

1. **n8n Account** ‚Äî [Sign up here](https://n8n.io/signup)
2. **OpenAI API Key** ‚Äî [Get your key here](https://youtu.be/YyaZ8zaGS-Q?si=bOw8C_TWgMg8S1hU)
3. **V0.dev Account** ‚Äî [Access v0 here](https://v0.dev/)
4. **A modern web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)

### Recommended Learning Path

We recommend completing the labs in sequence:

1. **Start with Lab 1.1** to understand prompt engineering fundamentals and n8n basics
2. **Move to Lab 1.2** to learn rapid UI prototyping with v0.dev
3. **Complete Lab 1.3** to integrate both platforms and build a complete solution

However, each lab is self-contained and can be completed independently based on your interests.
