    "# LLM-as-a-Judge Simply Explained: A Complete Guide to Run LLM Evals\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, the concept of “LLM as a Judge” has been gaining significant traction in the AI and NLP communities. As someone deeply involved in the field of LLM evaluation, I’ve seen firsthand how LLM judges are rapidly becoming the preferred method for evaluating language models. The reasons are clear: compared to traditional human evaluators, LLM judges offer faster, more scalable, and cost-effective assessments—eliminating much of the slow, expensive, and labor-intensive work that comes with manual review.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it’s important to recognize that LLM judges are not without their own challenges and limitations. Blindly relying on them can lead to misleading results and unnecessary frustration. That’s why, in this guide, I’ll share everything I’ve learned about leveraging LLM judges for system evaluation, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The core principles behind LLM-as-a-Judge\n",
    "- The practical benefits and pitfalls of automated evaluation\n",
    "- Step-by-step instructions for setting up and running LLM-based evals \n",

    "## What exactly is “LLM as a Judge”?\n",
    "\n",
    "“LLM-as-a-Judge” refers to the process of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate the outputs of other LLM systems. Instead of relying on human evaluators—which can be slow, expensive, and inconsistent—this approach leverages the reasoning and language understanding capabilities of LLMs to provide automated, scalable assessments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process typically works as follows:\n",
    "1. **Define Evaluation Criteria:** You start by crafting an evaluation prompt that clearly specifies the criteria you want to assess (such as accuracy, relevance, faithfulness, bias, or any custom metric).\n",
    "2. **Present Inputs and Outputs:** The LLM judge is given the original input (e.g., a question or task) and the output generated by the LLM system under evaluation.\n",
    "3. **Automated Scoring:** The LLM judge reviews the information and assigns a score or rating based on the defined criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM judges are commonly used to power advanced evaluation metrics like G-Eval, answer relevancy, faithfulness, and bias detection. By automating the evaluation process, LLM-as-a-Judge enables faster, more consistent, and more scalable assessments—making it an increasingly popular choice for both research and production environments.\n",

    "# Designing Key Terms and Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Hey! Now that we’re building our LLM contract evaluation system, let’s talk about two of the most important foundations: **Key Terms** and **Evaluation Metrics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Key Terms?\n",
    "\n",
    "Key terms are the specific contract clauses or topics that we want our system to automatically extract and analyze from any uploaded contract. Think of them as the “must-find” items in every contract review. By defining these up front, we ensure our tool is always looking for the most important legal concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key terms we’ve chosen:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Key Term                   | What It Means (in contracts)                                  |\n",
    "|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| Service Warranty           | Guarantees and standards for services provided                |\n",
    "| Limitation of Liability    | Limits on legal responsibility for damages or losses          |\n",
    "| Governing Law              | Which jurisdiction’s laws apply to the contract               |\n",
    "| Termination for Cause      | When and how the contract can be ended early                  |\n",
    "| Payment Terms              | Details about payment amounts, schedules, and methods         |\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Evaluation Metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we extract these key terms, we need a way to judge how well the extraction (and the LLM’s answer) matches what we want. That’s where evaluation metrics come in! These are the criteria we use to score and justify each answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We group our metrics into three categories, inspired by the HHH (Helpful, Honest, Harmless) framework:\n",

    "## 📄 What Does `extract_text_from_file` Do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hey! Now that we have our key terms and evaluation metrics set up, let’s talk about how we actually get the text out of the documents we want to analyze. That’s where the `extract_text_from_file` function comes in!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What’s the Purpose?\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is designed to **extract all the text** from a contract file, no matter if it’s a PDF, Word document, plain text, or even a CSV. It’s the first step in our pipeline—turning a file into something our LLM can read and analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does It Work? (Step by Step)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Figure Out the File Type**\n",
    "   - The function looks at the file extension (like `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt`, or `.csv`) to see what kind of document you’ve uploaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pick the Right Loader**\n",
    "   - Depending on the file type, it uses a special tool (called a “loader”) to read the file:\n",
    "     - **PDFs:** Uses `PyPDFLoader`\n",
    "     - **Word Docs (.docx, .doc):** Uses `Docx2txtLoader`\n",
    "     - **Text Files (.txt):** Uses `TextLoader`\n",
    "     - **CSV Files:** Uses `pandas.read_csv` to read the table and turn it into a string\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Extract the Text**\n",
    "   - For PDFs, Word, and text files, it grabs the text from each page or section and joins them all together into one big string.\n",
    "   - For CSVs, it converts the whole table into a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handle Unsupported Files**\n",
    "   - If you upload a file type it doesn’t recognize, it raises an error so you know something’s wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Return the Results**\n",
    "   - It gives you back two things:\n",
    "     - The **full extracted text** (as a string)\n",
    "     - The **list of document objects** (which can be useful if you want to know about page numbers or other metadata later)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Is This Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Universal Input:** You can upload contracts in different formats, and this function will handle them all.\n",
    "- **Foundation for Analysis:** The extracted text is what we’ll feed into our LLM to find key terms and evaluate the contract.\n",
    "- **Error Handling:** It makes sure you don’t accidentally try to process a file type that isn’t supported."
