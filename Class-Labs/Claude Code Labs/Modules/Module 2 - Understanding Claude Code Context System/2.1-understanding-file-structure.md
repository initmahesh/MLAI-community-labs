# Lesson 2.1: Understanding File Structure

## Overview

In this lesson, we will observe the file structure and see where files are present and how to manage them. This will help you understand how files are organized and how to navigate the module structure effectively.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this lesson, make sure you have:
- Completed Module 1
- Cloned the project that we have provided you

## File Structure

The project follows this structure:

```
project-setup/
├── CLAUDE.md # Project-level Claude instructions (SHARED)
├── CLAUDE.local.md # Personal customizations (NOT SHARED)
│
├── company-context/ # All company information
│   ├── company-overview.md # LegalGraph company details
│   ├── competitive-landscape.md # Market and competitor analysis
│   ├── user-personas.md # Three personas (Jennifer, David, Rachel)
│   └── product-description.md # Product features and roadmap
│
└── templates/ # Output format templates
    ├── market-research-format.md # Structure for market research
    ├── user-research-format.md # Structure for user research
    └── prd-template.md # PRD template with all sections
```

## Understanding the File Structure

The project setup you cloned in Module 1 is where we will be working. This structure is designed to efficiently manage context and output formats:

### company-context/ Directory

The `company-context/` folder contains all the details about your company. These files serve as context that Claude Code will use when performing tasks. By adding these files to the context, Claude will have all the necessary information about:
- Your company overview and details
- Competitive landscape and market analysis
- User personas
- Product description and features

This means you don't need to repeatedly explain your company details in every prompt - Claude will already have this context available.

### templates/ Directory

The `templates/` folder contains predefined output format templates for:
- **Market Research (MR)** - `market-research-format.md`
- **User Research (UR)** - `user-research-format.md`
- **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** - `prd-template.md`

These templates define the exact structure and format that outputs should follow. By setting these templates as context, you eliminate the need to iterate on prompts repeatedly to get the desired format. Simply set the context first with the appropriate template, and Claude will follow that format automatically.

### Workflow

1. **Set Context First**: Add the relevant files from `company-context/` to provide Claude with company information
2. **Set Format**: Add the appropriate template from `templates/` to define the output structure
3. **Execute Task**: Claude will use the context and follow the predefined format, reducing the need for multiple iterations

### About CLAUDE.md and CLAUDE.local.md

You might be wondering what the `CLAUDE.md` and `CLAUDE.local.md` files are doing here. These are special files that play an important role in how Claude Code works with your project. We will learn about these files in detail in the next lesson (2.2 - Understanding Claude Code Context System), where we'll explore how they function and how to use them effectively.
