# Lesson 2.2: Understanding Claude Code Context System

## Overview

In this lesson, we will be learning how context actually set in Claude. This is a fundamental concept that will help you understand how to effectively use Claude Code's context system to enhance your productivity and get better results.

## Understanding CLAUDE.md

You have seen in the project that we have a `CLAUDE.md` file. This file is a special file that stands for setting context for Claude Code in your project.

### Creating CLAUDE.md Using the /init Command

When you first start Claude in a new project, you can run the `/init` command. This tells Claude to analyze your entire codebase and understand:

- The project's purpose and architecture
- Important commands and critical files
- Coding patterns and structure

After analyzing your code, Claude creates a summary and writes it to a `CLAUDE.md` file. When Claude asks for permission to create this file, you can either:
- Hit **Enter** to approve each write operation
- Press **Shift+Tab** to let Claude write files freely throughout your session

The `/init` command will automatically create a `CLAUDE.md` file based on Claude's analysis of your project.


### Manually Creating CLAUDE.md

Alternatively, if you want to set the context yourself, you can manually create a file named `CLAUDE.md` and set your context there. This gives you full control over what context Claude has about your project.

### What Does CLAUDE.md Do?

The `CLAUDE.md` file plays a crucial role in how Claude understands and works with your project. Think of it as your project's instruction manual for Claude. Here's what it does:

**1. Provides Project Guidance**
The file helps Claude navigate through your project by highlighting what matters most - important commands you use, your project's architecture, and the coding style you follow. This means Claude won't have to guess how your project is structured or what conventions you prefer.

**2. Enables Custom Instructions**
You can use this file to give Claude specific directions tailored to your project. Whether it's following certain patterns, using particular tools, or adhering to specific guidelines, you can document it all here.

**3. Acts as a Persistent Context**
Here's the key benefit: the `CLAUDE.md` file gets automatically included in every request you make to Claude. This means you don't have to repeat important project information in every conversation. It's like having a persistent system prompt that's always active for your project, ensuring Claude consistently understands your codebase and preferences.

### Types of CLAUDE.md Files

![images](./images/claudemdfile.png)

Claude recognizes three different `CLAUDE.md` files that can be placed in different locations, each serving a specific purpose:

1. **CLAUDE.md** (Project root)
   - Generated with `/init` command
   - Committed to source control
   - Shared with other engineers on your team
   - Contains project-wide instructions and context

2. **CLAUDE.local.md** (Project root)
   - Not shared with other engineers (typically in `.gitignore`)
   - Contains personal instructions and customizations for Claude
   - Perfect for your individual preferences and workflows
   - This is the file you saw in the project structure earlier

3. **~/.claude/CLAUDE.md** (Home directory)
   - Used with all projects on your machine
   - Contains instructions that you want Claude to follow across all projects
   - Useful for global preferences, coding standards, or personal workflows that apply everywhere

While Claude recognizes all three types of files, in this course we will be working with two files: `CLAUDE.md` and `CLAUDE.local.md`. These two files will give you a good balance between shared project context and personal customizations.

## Adding Custom Instructions

You can customize how Claude behaves by adding instructions to your `CLAUDE.md` file. For example, if Claude is not following your preferred code formatting style, you can address this by updating the file.

### Using Memory Mode with the # Command

Use the `#` command to enter "memory mode" - this lets you edit your `CLAUDE.md` files intelligently. Just type something like:

```
# Keep responses concise and focus on practical solutions.
```

Claude will merge this instruction into your `CLAUDE.md` file automatically. This is a quick and efficient way to add custom instructions without manually editing the file yourself. The memory mode understands context and will place your instruction in the appropriate section of the file.

## File Mentions with '@'

When you need Claude to look at specific files, use the `@` symbol followed by the file path. This automatically includes that file's contents in your request to Claude.

For example, if you want to ask about your company information and you know the relevant files, you can type:

```
What are the key details about our company? @company-context
```

Claude will show you a list of company-related files to choose from, then include the selected file in your conversation. This makes it easy to reference specific files without having to copy and paste their contents manually.

## Referencing Files in CLAUDE.md

You can also mention files directly in your `CLAUDE.md` file using the same `@` syntax. This is particularly useful for files that are relevant to many aspects of your project.

For example, if you go to the project under `CLAUDE.md`, you can pass your company-context and templates file names using `@` file name syntax. You might add something like this to your `CLAUDE.md`:

```
Company information is available in @company-context/company-overview.md, @company-context/user-personas.md, and @company-context/competitive-landscape.md.

Output format templates are defined in @templates/market-research-format.md, @templates/user-research-format.md, and @templates/prd-template.md.
```

When you mention a file this way, its contents are automatically included in every request, so Claude can answer questions about your company information immediately without having to search for and read the file each time. This is especially useful for files that contain foundational information that Claude needs to reference frequently throughout your work.

## What's Next

Now you have understood the file structure and how we pass context in Claude. You've learned about:
- The different types of `CLAUDE.md` files and their purposes
- How to add custom instructions using memory mode
- How to reference files using the `@` symbol in conversations and in `CLAUDE.md`

It's time to do something hands-on! In the next lesson (2.3 - Market Research Using Context), we will be doing market research using the context we have set up. You'll see how all these concepts come together to help you perform real Product Management tasks efficiently.
