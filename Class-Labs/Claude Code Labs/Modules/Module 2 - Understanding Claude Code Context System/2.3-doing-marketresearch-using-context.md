#### How Claude Processes This Query

Now let's break down how Claude processes this query:

The moment you put this query, Claude Code already has context about your company in `CLAUDE.md`. In that file, we have mentioned which files to refer to for doing market research as context. 

As you can see, Claude will read the `company-context` folder to do market research because we have already set our context in the `CLAUDE.md` file. This means Claude doesn't need you to manually specify which files to look at - it automatically knows to use the company context files you've referenced in `CLAUDE.md`.

#### Web Search Tool Access

Now Claude Code is asking whether to access the web search tool or not. You will see 3 options - as per your preference, you can select the option that best suits your needs. This allows Claude to search the web for additional market research information if needed.

#### File Storage Option

Now it is asking you to save the result in the file. First, it will ask to create a folder if it's not present, then it will create the file. Just press **Yes** - based on your preference, you can select any option. This is because we have provided in the context to save the output in a file. This allows you to save the market research results to a file for future reference.

#### Processing and Output

Now it will take 3-5 minutes because it works on thinking mode. At the end, it will first create a folder on its own if not present, named **output**, and then create a **market-research.md** file with the output. This file will contain the comprehensive market research results based on the context you've provided.
