# My Personal PM Preferences

## Communication Style
- Keep responses concise (max 500 words unless specified)
- Use bullet points for lists
- Always show word count at end of documents
- Prefer actionable recommendations over theory

## Custom Shortcuts
- "quick market scan" = abbreviated market research (3 competitors max, focus on pricing/positioning)
- "draft PRD" = use prd-template.md structure, cite research findings

## My Workflow
- Include confidence levels (High/Medium/Low) in all recommendations
- Flag any assumptions being made
- When unsure, ask clarifying questions rather than guessing

## Current Focus
- Enterprise customers (Series B+ companies, $50M+ revenue)
- Security and compliance features are priority
- Mid-market positioning (not SMB, not Fortune 500)

## What I Don't Need
- Long introductions or background (I know the context)
- Multiple options when one clear recommendation exists
- Generic advice not specific to LegalGraph
