# Welcome to Lab-0 (Doing the Pre-requisites)

## Here we will learn how to set up google colab and also how to get you OpenAI key. This will be a normal walk-through where we show you how to create a runtime, run code, upload files in colab and also get the key for OpenAI.

### Pre-requisites
* Google account

## Creating OpenAI key

### Firstly visit the OpenAI playground
