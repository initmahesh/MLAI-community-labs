### **What You'll Achieve** 🎯

By the end of this lab, you'll gain a deep understanding of **Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** and how to we solve the accuracy problem in scenarios where a simple RAG pipeline fails.

---

#### **1. Storing Documents Intelligently Using Vector Embeddings** 🗂️
- **What**: Learn how to convert documents into numerical representations (vector embeddings) that capture their meaning.
- **How**: Use **ChromaDB**, a vector database, to store and organize these embeddings efficiently.
- **Why**: This allows the system to understand and retrieve information based on semantic meaning, not just keywords.

---

#### **2. Retrieving Information with Semantic Understanding** 🔍
- **What**: Discover how to fetch relevant information from a large document collection using semantic search.
- **How**: Leverage **LangChain** to query ChromaDB and retrieve the most contextually relevant chunks.
- **Why**: This ensures that the system understands the intent behind your questions, not just the literal words.

---

#### **3. Generating Context-Aware Answers Using Agentic Decision-Making** 🤖
- **What**: Explore how **Agentic RAG** makes smart decisions about how to answer questions.
- **How**: Implement a decision-making agent that evaluates the confidence of retrieved information and chooses the best response strategy.
- **Why**: This allows the system to provide accurate and contextually appropriate answers, even when the information is incomplete or ambiguous.

---

#### **4. Optimizing Responses Through Knowledge Graph Enhancements** 🧠
- **What**: Learn how to enhance answers by connecting related concepts using a knowledge graph.
- **How**: Build a knowledge graph that maps terms and relationships (e.g., "Master Agreement" → "Contract") to improve understanding.
- **Why**: This enables the system to provide more comprehensive and insightful answers by leveraging contextual connections.

# **Step 2: Setting Up the Lab 🧪**

---
## Import necessary modules
Before we start, we need to install the necessary tools. These packages are like the ingredients for our recipe – without them, the lab won't work!

# 📌 Explanation of Imported Modules  

## 🔹 UI Components  
- **`ipywidgets`** → Provides interactive widgets like buttons, text boxes, and dropdowns.

# 📌 **Step 4: Upload & Process a PDF Document**  

This step allows users to upload a PDF file, extract its text, split it into smaller chunks, and store it in a vector database for AI processing.  

## 🔹 How It Works  
1. **File Upload Widget**  
   - A button appears that lets you upload a **PDF file**.  
   - The system only accepts **one file at a time**.  

2. **Processing the File**  
   - When you click the **"Process File"** button:  
     - The system checks if a file is uploaded.  
     - If no file is found, it shows a message: **"No file uploaded!"**  
     - If a file is uploaded, the system reads the PDF and extracts its text.  
     - The text is split into smaller **chunks** (for efficient processing).  
     - Each chunk is assigned a **random confidence score**.  
     - The data is stored in **ChromaDB**, a special AI-ready database.  

3. **Success Message**  
   - If everything works, you’ll see a **green notification box**:  
     ```
     File processed with confidence scores!
     ```  
   - This means your file was successfully processed and stored. 

```python
# Step 4: File upload widget with value storage
import random
# Step 4: File upload widget with value storage
import random
uploader = widgets.FileUpload(accept='.pdf', multiple=False)
process_btn = widgets.Button(description="Process File")
process_output = widgets.Output()

process_btn = widgets.Button(description="Process File")
process_output = widgets.Output()

def process_file(b):
    with process_output:
        clear_output()
        if not uploader.value:
            print("No file uploaded!")
            return

        for filename, file_info in uploader.value.items():
            pdf = PdfReader(BytesIO(file_info['content']))
            break


        for filename, file_info in uploader.value.items():
            pdf = PdfReader(BytesIO(file_info['content']))
            break

        text = "\n".join([page.extract_text() for page in pdf.pages])
        text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
            chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=100
        )
        text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
            chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=100
        )
        chunks = text_splitter.split_text(text)
        metadatas = [{"value": random.uniform(0, 1)} for _ in chunks]

        Chroma.from_texts(
            chunks, embeddings,
            client=chroma_client,
            collection_name="doc_collection",
            metadatas=metadatas
        )
        print(boxen("File processed with confidence scores!", title="Success", color="green"))

display(uploader, process_btn, process_output)
process_btn.on_click(process_file)
``` 

## 🔹 Steps to Use  
✅ **Step 1** → Click on **"Upload Document"** and select a PDF file.  
✅ **Step 2** → Click **"Process File"** to analyze and store it.  
✅ **Step 3** → Wait for the **success message** confirming the file is processed.  

**✅ NOTE** : [📄Reference Document You Can Download From CLick Me](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WWa_TgI49HIAGFuXTNvMLtkFBU6ZduHq/view?usp=sharing)

This setup makes it easy to upload and process PDFs with AI-powered storage. 🚀

# 📝 Step 5: Enhanced Query Processing with an Agent  

This step enhances **query processing** by implementing an **AI agent** that decides how to answer user queries based on **confidence scores**. It retrieves relevant document chunks and determines whether the response should be **directly generated** or **refined using a knowledge graph** for better accuracy.  

---
## 🔹 Overview of the Query Processing Flow  

### 1️⃣ **User Query Retrieval**  
- The user submits a **query**.
- The system **retrieves relevant document chunks** using ChromaDB.
- Each retrieved chunk has an **associated confidence score**.

### 2️⃣ **Confidence Score Evaluation**  
- If the confidence score is **high (≥ 0.5)** → Use a **direct answer** approach.
- If the confidence score is **low (< 0.3)** → Use a **knowledge-enhanced answer**.

### 3️⃣ **Knowledge Graph Enhancement** (for low-confidence cases)  
- Some terms in the query are mapped to **more meaningful alternatives** using a **knowledge graph**.
- The query is **rewritten** with these enhancements.
- A new document search is performed using the improved query.

### 4️⃣ **Generating the Final Answer**  
- The system **chooses the best response strategy** using an autonomous agent.
- The **final answer is generated** based on the refined context and confidence evaluation.

---

## 🔍 **Understanding Confidence Scores**  

A **confidence score** is a measure of **how relevant** a retrieved document chunk is to the user's query.  
- **Higher confidence (≥ 0.5)** → The retrieved text is **relevant and reliable**.  
- **Lower confidence (< 0.3)** → The retrieved text **may not be relevant or sufficient**.  

### 📌 **How is the Confidence Score Used?**  
- If the retrieved document chunk has a **high confidence score**, the system can **directly answer the query**.  
- If the retrieved document chunk has a **low confidence score**, the AI **enhances the query** using a **knowledge graph** and **retrieves better chunks**.

---

## 🤖 **Role of the AI Agent**  

The **AI Agent** acts as a **decision-maker** that chooses the **best answering approach** based on **confidence scores**.  

### 🔹 **How the Agent Works**
1. **User submits a query**.
2. **Document chunks are retrieved** from the database.
3. **Each chunk has an associated confidence score**.
4. The AI agent **analyzes the confidence scores** and chooses:
   - ✅ **Direct Answer** → If confidence is **high (≥ 0.5)**.
   - 🔄 **Enhanced Answer** → If confidence is **low (< 0.3)**, it **rewrites the query** and **retrieves better chunks**.
5. The chosen **answering tool is executed**, and the **final response** is provided.

```python
# Step 5: Enhanced query processing with autonomous agent
class QueryInput(BaseModel):
    query: str = Field(description="User's original question")
    chunks: List[Dict] = Field(description="Retrieved document chunks with confidence scores")

def retrieve_chunks(query: str) -> List[Dict]:
    collection = chroma_client.get_collection("doc_collection")
    results = collection.query(
        query_texts=[query],
        n_results=1,
        include=['documents', 'metadatas']
    )

    # Ensure metadata is returned and handle cases where it's missing
    documents = results['documents'][0]
    metadatas = results.get('metadatas', [[{}] * len(documents)])[0]  # Default to empty dicts if metadata is missing

    # Simulate low-confidence chunks for testing
    simulated_chunks = [
        {"text": doc, "value": random.uniform(0.2, 0.4)}  # Simulate low confidence scores (0.2 to 0.4)
        for doc, meta in zip(documents, metadatas)
    ]

    return simulated_chunks

def knowledge_graph(query: str) -> str:
    # Enhanced knowledge graph mappings
    kg_mappings = {
        "customer": "Company Name Referenced in Master Agreement Only",
        "Master Agreement": "Contract",
        "Service Order": "Service Agreement"
    }
    
    # Replace terms in the query using the knowledge graph mappings
    enhanced_query = query
    for term, replacement in kg_mappings.items():
        enhanced_query = enhanced_query.replace(term, replacement)

    
    return enhanced_query

def base_answer(input: QueryInput) -> str:
    context = "\n\n".join([chunk["text"] for chunk in input.chunks])
    prompt = f"Answer: {input.query}\nContext:\n{context}"
    answer = llm(prompt)
    values = [f"{chunk['value']:.2f}" for chunk in input.chunks]
    return f"Answer: {answer}\nConfidence Scores: {values}"

def enhanced_answer(input: QueryInput) -> str:
    enhanced_query = knowledge_graph(input.query)
    enhanced_chunks = retrieve_chunks(enhanced_query)
    context = "\n\n".join([chunk["text"] for chunk in enhanced_chunks])
    prompt = f"Answer: {enhanced_query}\nContext:\n{context}"
    answer = llm(prompt)
    values = [f"{chunk['value']:.2f}" for chunk in enhanced_chunks]
    return f"Optimized Answer: {answer}\nEnhanced Confidence: {values}"


# Define Tools 
tools = [
    StructuredTool.from_function(
        name="DirectAnswer",
        description="Use this when the retrieved chunks have high confidence scores (>= 0.5) and sufficient context to directly answer the query.",
        func=base_answer
    ),
    StructuredTool.from_function(
        name="EnhancedAnswer",
        description="Use this when the retrieved chunks have low confidence scores (< 0.3) or insufficient context, and the query needs to be enhanced using a knowledge graph.",
        func=enhanced_answer
    )
]

# Initialize the agent with a custom prompt
agent_prompt = """You are an intelligent assistant that decides how to answer user queries based on the context and confidence scores of retrieved document chunks.

Here are the tools available to you:
1. DirectAnswer: Use this when the retrieved chunks have high confidence scores (>= 0.5) and sufficient context to directly answer the query.
2. EnhancedAnswer: Use this when the retrieved chunks have low confidence scores (< 0.3) or insufficient context, and the query needs to be enhanced using a knowledge graph.

Your task is to analyze the query, retrieved chunks, and their confidence scores, and decide which tool to use. Provide a reason for your decision.

Query: {query}
Retrieved Chunks: {chunks}

Decision: Which tool should be used? Respond in the following format:
Tool: [DirectAnswer or EnhancedAnswer]
Reason: [Your reasoning]"""

# 🎯 **Final Outcome**
- If the retrieved document is **relevant**, the AI answers immediately.  
- If the information is **uncertain**, the AI **optimizes** the search before answering.  
- The AI agent makes **independent decisions** for the best response. 🚀  

This **smart decision-making** process makes the AI **more intelligent and reliable** for answering document-based queries. 📖✨  

---

# 📝 **Step 6: Query Interface with Autonomous Decision-Making**  

This step introduces an **interactive query interface** that allows users to input their questions.  
The AI agent **analyzes** the query, **retrieves relevant document chunks**, and **decides how to answer**  
based on confidence scores. The decision-making is fully **autonomous**, ensuring **optimized responses**.

---

## 🎯 **How the Query Interface Works**  

### 🔹 **User Input & Query Submission**  
- You have to enters their query in the input field (`query_input`).
- Clicking the "Submit" button (`submit_btn`) triggers the `handle_query` function.

# 🔍 Step-by-Step Query Processing Flow
**1️⃣ Step 1: Query Asked**
- The user inputs a query.
- The query is displayed in a notification box for reference.

**2️⃣ Step 2: Retrieve Relevant Chunks**
- The query is searched in the document database (ChromaDB).
- The most relevant text chunks are retrieved, along with their confidence scores.
- Retrieved chunks are displayed in a green notification box.

**3️⃣ Step 3: Generate an Initial (Poor) Answer**
- The system tries to generate an answer from the retrieved chunks.
- This is an unoptimized response that might be incorrect due to low confidence scores.
- The poor answer is displayed in a red notification box.

**4️⃣ Step 4: AI Agent Decision**
- The AI agent analyzes the retrieved chunks and confidence scores.
- It decides whether to:
  - Use the DirectAnswer tool (if confidence scores are high).
  - Use the EnhancedAnswer tool (if confidence scores are low).
- The agent's decision is displayed in a magenta notification box.

**5️⃣ Step 5: Generate the Final Answer**

✅ If the agent chooses "DirectAnswer"
- The initial answer is used without modifications.

✅ If the agent chooses "EnhancedAnswer"
- The query is refined by agnet using a Knowledge Graph.
- A new set of relevant document chunks is retrieved.
- A more optimized answer is generated.
