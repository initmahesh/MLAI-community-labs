## ðŸ”¹ Lab 1.1 â€“ Introduction to Prompt Engineering

In this lab, youâ€™ll gain a foundational understanding of how prompts influence the behavior of language models. You will:
- Learn how to write clear, structured, and goal-oriented prompts
- Understand how prompt phrasing affects model outputs
- Experiment with different prompt styles and strategies
- Use Langflow to visualize prompt-response behavior

By the end of Lab 1.1, you'll be comfortable crafting effective prompts and observing how they impact the model's reasoning and output.

## ðŸ”¹ Lab 1.2 â€“ Langflow Integration with v0 - (Build a Complete AI-Powered Competitor Analysis Tool)

In this lab, we are going to learn how to integrate a Langflow backend with a frontend built using v0. This hands-on guide will walk you through the process of connecting your Langflow flow to a UI generated in v0.

- How Langflow is embedded or linked within v0
- Tavily for web-based search and retrieval
- A custom flow to bring together all the logi
