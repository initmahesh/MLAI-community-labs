        "We are developing an legal assistant designed to provide precise, context-aware answers to legal queries. Instead of manually reviewing lengthy contracts, users can simply ask questions, and extract and summarize relevant information from structured legal datasets. Whether it’s identifying key clauses, summarizing obligations, or clarifying terms, our solution enhances efficiency and accuracy in legal document analysis empowering users to make informed decisions with ease.  \n",

        "- A structured dataset containing a wide range of Master Service Agreement (MSA) examples and corresponding questions.  \n",
        "- A testing dataset to evaluate and refine the model’s accuracy.  \n",

        "  - **Document content**, systematically organized by page numbers.  \n",
        "  - **Relevant legal questions**.  \n",

        "Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools for processing and understanding language, but fine-tuning them for specific tasks can be challenging because of their enormous size and computational demands. This is where Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) comes in, offering an efficient solution for fine-tuning LLMs without needing to adjust every parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of modifying the entire model, LoRA focuses on a small, manageable subset of parameters. Here’s a simplified breakdown of how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Normally, LLMs use a large matrix of parameters (W0) to make decisions. This matrix is huge and computationally expensive to adjust.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. LoRA introduces two smaller matrices, A and B, which are much narrower than W0. These matrices represent a low-rank update to the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Instead of retraining the entire matrix W0, LoRA modifies only these smaller matrices, making the fine-tuning process much faster and more efficient. The result is a model update that’s nearly as effective as full fine-tuning but requires significantly fewer computational resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. In a typical LLM layer, the output is calculated as output = W0x + b0. LoRA adds a new term, BAx, where A and B are the smaller matrices. This allows the model to adapt to new tasks without modifying the original large matrix W0.\n",
