## ðŸ”¹ Lab-1.1 Build-a-No-Code-AI-Agent-with-Prompt-Engineering

### **Goal**
As an **AI Product Manager**, you'll define product requirements and design intelligent AI agents without technical dependencies, using Langflow's visual interface to prototype and validate AI-powered product features.

### **What You Will Learn**
- Master prompt engineering as a core product management skill for AI features
- Design user-centered prompts that align with product goals and user needs
- Understand how prompt strategies impact user experience and product performance
- Use Langflow's visual builder to communicate AI workflows to technical teams

## ðŸ”¹ Lab-1.2 Deploy-a-Langflow-Agent-with-V0-and-Shareable-UI

### **Goal**
Learn how to integrate Langflow agents with V0.dev to build a shareable UI â€” all without writing code. This lab teaches you to turn your Langflow logic into a product with real user interaction capabilities.

### **What You Will Learn**
- Connect Langflow with V0 to build UIs without code
- Deploy and test your Langflow agents via a real interface
- Enable prompt-to-product pipeline using visual workflows
- Understand how to iterate fast as a product manager

## ðŸ”¹ Lab-1.3 Connect-Langflow-with-Custom-Frontend

### **Goal**
As an **AI Product Manager**, youâ€™ll lead the end-to-end development by integrating a custom frontend (using React/Next.js) with a Langflow backend, focusing on delivering seamless UI/UX powered by real-time LLM responses.

### **What You Will Learn**
- How to trigger Langflow flows from a custom UI via API
- Pass dynamic user input to Langflow and get real-time AI responses
- Design structured UI (e.g., competitor comparison table) based on AI output
- Build feedback loops between frontend and backend for intelligent UX
- Collaborate cross-functionally across design, engineering, and ML teams
