# Integrating Langflow with V0

This lab aims to integrate Langflow, a powerful tool for building frontend applications, with V0, a generative user interface system. This integration enables the creation of interactive and user-friendly interfaces for LangChain applications.

# Lab 1 - Building a User Interface for Your Langflow Agent with V0

In this lab, weâ€™ll build a functional web app using plain English, then connect it to the agentic system we previously built in Langflow. This gives you a near-real experience you can share with customers, gather feedback quickly, and begin iterating right away.
