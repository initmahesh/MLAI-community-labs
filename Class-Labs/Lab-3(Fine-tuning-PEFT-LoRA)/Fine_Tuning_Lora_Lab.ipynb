        "# Teaching AI to Answer Questions About Legal Documents 🤖📄\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine you're helping your parents understand a long contract they received. It's full of complicated words and takes long time to read! You wish you had a smart helper who could quickly find answers about what's in the contract. That's exactly what we're building - an AI assistant that can read and understand legal documents!\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Problem 🤔\n",
        "* Master Service Agreements (MSAs) are super long and confusing\n",
        "* Finding specific information (like \"What happens to customer data?\") takes too much time\n",
        "* Even when you find the right section, the legal language is hard to understand\n",
        "* People need quick, simple answers to their questions about these documents\n",
        "\n",
        "## Our Solution! 🌟\n",
        "We're creating an AI helper that can:\n",
        "1. Read through entire legal documents\n",
        "2. Understand questions about the document\n",
        "3. Find the relevant information\n",
        "4. Give clear, simple answers\n",
        "\n",
        "## How We're Training Our AI 📚\n",
        "We're using:\n",
        "* A training dataset with lots of MSA examples and questions\n",
        "* A testing dataset to check how well our AI learns\n",
        "* Each example in our dataset includes:\n",
        "  - The document content (organized by page numbers)\n",
        "  - Questions about the document\n",
        "  - The correct answers\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, we ask questions like:\n",
        "> \"Does this contract mention what happens to customer data after termination?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "## Our Special Teaching Method 🎯\n",
        "We're using a clever technique called LoRA that helps our AI learn quickly and efficiently. Think of it like:\n",
        "* Teaching someone to ride an electric bike when they already know how to ride a regular bike\n",
        "* They don't need to learn everything from scratch - just the new parts!\n",
        "\n",
        "## What Makes Our Project Special? ✨\n",
        "* Uses real legal documents (MSAs) for training\n",
        "* Focuses on practical, everyday questions people have about contracts\n",
        "* Makes legal documents more accessible to everyone\n",
        "* Can be improved over time with more training data"

        "Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools for processing and understanding language, but fine-tuning them for specific tasks can be challenging because of their enormous size and computational demands. This is where Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) comes in, offering an efficient solution for fine-tuning LLMs without needing to adjust every parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of modifying the entire model, LoRA focuses on a small, manageable subset of parameters. Here’s a simplified breakdown of how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Normally, LLMs use a large matrix of parameters (W0) to make decisions. This matrix is huge and computationally expensive to adjust.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. LoRA introduces two smaller matrices, A and B, which are much narrower than W0. These matrices represent a low-rank update to the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Instead of retraining the entire matrix W0, LoRA modifies only these smaller matrices, making the fine-tuning process much faster and more efficient. The result is a model update that’s nearly as effective as full fine-tuning but requires significantly fewer computational resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. In a typical LLM layer, the output is calculated as output = W0x + b0. LoRA adds a new term, BAx, where A and B are the smaller matrices. This allows the model to adapt to new tasks without modifying the original large matrix W0.\n",

        "# Cell 8 Configuring LoRA for Our AI Model 🎯\n",
        "\n",
        "## What is LoRA? 🤔\n",
        "LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is like giving our AI a special notebook to write down new things it learns. Instead of rewriting everything it knows, it just adds new notes about legal documents! for more I have explain above..\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Let's Break Down Each Setting! 📋\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. LoRA Attention (r=32) 📚\n",
        "- Like deciding how many new things to learn at once\n",
        "- Higher number = can learn more complex things\n",
        "- Lower number = learns faster but simpler things\n",
        "- 32 is like a \"just right\" amount!\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Alpha Scaling (lora_alpha=64) 🎚️\n",
        "- Like setting how much attention to pay to new information\n",
        "- Higher number = pays more attention to new learning\n",
        "- Lower number = sticks more to what it already knows\n",
        "- 64 means it will focus well on learning about legal documents\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Target Modules 🎯\n",
        "```python\n",
        "target_modules=[\n",
        "    \"o_proj\",        # Output processing\n",
        "    \"qkv_proj\",      # Understanding context\n",
        "    \"gate_up_proj\",  # Decision making\n",
        "    \"up_proj\",       # Learning new patterns\n",
        "    \"down_proj\",     # Simplifying information\n",
        "    \"lm_head\",       # Language understanding\n",
        "]\n",
        "```\n",
        "- Like choosing which subjects to study\n",
        "- Each module handles different types of learning\n",
        "- We're updating all important parts of the AI's \"brain\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Dropout (lora_dropout=0.1) 🎲\n",
        "- Like taking short breaks while studying\n",
        "- Helps prevent memorizing without understanding\n",
        "- 0.1 means 10% chance of taking a \"break\"\n",
        "- Helps the AI learn more robustly\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Task Type (task_type=\"CAUSAL_LM\") 📖\n",
        "- Tells the AI what kind of learning to do\n",
        "- \"CAUSAL_LM\" means learning to predict what comes next\n",
        "- Like learning to complete sentences in a story\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why These Settings Are Important? 🌟\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Efficient Learning 🚀\n",
        "- Only updates what's needed\n",
        "- Saves computer memory\n",
        "- Learns faster than traditional methods\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Better Understanding 🧠\n",
        "- Focuses on important parts of legal language\n",
        "- Maintains general language knowledge\n",
        "- Adds new legal expertise\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Reliable Results ✅\n",
        "- Prevents forgetting old knowledge\n",
        "- Balances new and existing information\n",
        "- Gives consistent answers\n",
        "\n",
        "## Think of It Like... 📝\n",
        "Imagine a student who:\n",
        "- Already knows English well\n",
        "- Is learning legal terms\n",
        "- Uses a special notebook for legal definitions\n",
        "- Can still remember everything else they knew before\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember: Just like how students need the right study plan to learn effectively, our AI needs the right LoRA settings to learn about legal documents properly! 🎓"

        "# Setting Up the Trainer: Key Notes\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Purpose:**  \n",
        "   This code sets up a **Trainer** using the Hugging Face library to train a machine learning model efficiently with the necessary configurations and datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Main Components:**\n",
        "   - **Model:** The pre-trained `model` to be fine-tuned on the given dataset.\n",
        "   - **Datasets:**  \n",
        "     - `tokenized_train_dataset`: The data used for training the model.  \n",
        "     - `tokenized_validation_dataset`: The data used to evaluate the model's performance during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Training Arguments:**  \n",
        "   These define how the training process will run:  \n",
        "   - **Output Directory:** Saves the model checkpoints and logs in `./phi-1_5-finetune-msa`.  \n",
        "   - **Epochs:** The model will train for 1 epoch (1 full pass through the training dataset).  \n",
        "   - **Warmup Ratio:** 10% of training steps used for learning rate warm-up.  \n",
        "   - **Batch Size:** Processes 4 samples per device during training and evaluation.  \n",
        "   - **Gradient Accumulation:** Accumulates gradients over 4 steps to reduce memory load.  \n",
        "   - **Gradient Checkpointing:** Saves memory during training.  \n",
        "   - **Max Steps:** Limits training to 100 steps.  \n",
        "   - **Learning Rate:** The learning rate is set to `5e-4`.  \n",
        "   - **FP16:** Enables mixed precision for faster training.  \n",
        "   - **Logging:** Logs training details every 10 steps in `./logs`.  \n",
        "   - **Save Strategy:** Saves model checkpoints every 50 steps.  \n",
        "   - **Evaluation:** Evaluates the model every 50 steps and keeps the best model based on **loss**.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Data Collator:**  \n",
        "   Uses the `DataCollatorForLanguageModeling` to prepare batches without masked language modeling (`mlm=False`).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Training the Model:**  \n",
        "   - Finally, the `trainer.train()` command starts the training process using the configurations and datasets.\n",
