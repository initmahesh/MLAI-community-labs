# Vertex AI Agents

In this readme we will show you how you can build you own agent and use it for generating answers regarding your queries, while customizing it to answer questions only related to particular questions. Integrating external knowledge sources, writing OpenAPI spec for these sources.

**PS**: Integration of these agents using Python SDK in a notebook will be coming soon. Hang tight!! :)

## So why do we need Agents?

Agents are like your customized personal assistants.

- They will learn whatever you train them to become.
- They can refer to external knowledge sources and API.
- They have information about external world knowledge.
- They can answer questions in a proper format that you provide.
- Integrate them to your existing system and use it for generating responses.

Also Here we will be using Multi Agent Configuration:

Here One Main Agent `Car Repair Agent` will call `CRM Agent` that will use the Airtable tool to save data in the table. Also the Car Repair Agent will be interactive Car mechanic that can use the Places API to get nearest Garage information.

## Prerequisites

- Create a service accout and project in google cloud console.
  [Google Console Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

Now we have created our App and we will move on to customizing it.

## Configuration of the First Agent

1. First set the Name of the Playbook, here this Playbook will be responsible for Inserting data to Airtable CRM, so we name the playbook as `CRM`

![image](./assets/images/4.png)

   <!-- ![image](https://github.com/initmahesh/MLAI-community-labs/assets/72710483/5557733b-c688-4853-b8d4-225b6cfcf9ac) -->

2. Then we set the description of the Agent as

   `You are a database engineer and you need to make entries to a CRM table.`

   ![image](https://github.com/initmahesh/MLAI-community-labs/assets/72710483/42f138fc-bb4e-49b2-a5dc-7d032573b8dd)

3. Then click on the `+ Data Store` option to add the Airtable tool for the Agent to use.

4. You will be landed on this page, where we will Configure out tool.

   ![image](https://github.com/initmahesh/MLAI-community-labs/assets/72710483/92db4794-2651-43e3-a121-a74b4d06aa1c)

5. Set the Name of the tool as `Airtable CRM`

   ![image](https://github.com/initmahesh/MLAI-community-labs/assets/72710483/c862c6a3-c739-4904-8e45-a00389175a78)

6. Select `Open API` from the dropdown menu in the `Type` field

   ![image](https://github.com/initmahesh/MLAI-community-labs/assets/72710483/6f13e7fc-8eb8-45ff-a23e-08922922a85f)

7. Set the description of the tool as

   `This tool is used to call the Airtable CRM to save the information.`

   ![image](https://github.com/initmahesh/MLAI-community-labs/assets/72710483/2d5cb5fd-a1fd-4c94-9adf-df19ddefa994)

8. Then we will setup the `Schema`, Select `YAML` as the type

   ![image](https://github.com/initmahesh/MLAI-community-labs/assets/72710483/be87aeef-334a-4bf3-b56e-15ccb2ba4a10)

9. Copy paste the schema given below and replace the path of the Airtable with you own.

   ```yaml
   openapi: 3.0.1
   info:
     title: Airtable CRM insert data API
     description: Inserts the customer information in the Airtable CRM using the API
     version: '1.0.0'

         summary: Insert customer information in the table
         operationId: customerInformation
         requestBody:
           required: true
           content:
             application/json:
               schema:

                           properties:
                             # type: object
                             # properties:
                             Name:
                               type: string
                               description: Name of the customer.
                             PhoneNumber:
                               type: number
                               description: Phone Number of the customer.
                             CurrentAddress:
                               type: string
                               description: Current address of the customer.

         responses:
           '200':
             description: Successful response
             content:
               application/json:
                 schema:
                   type: object
                   properties:

10. Select the `Bearer Token` option in the `Authentication type` and paste your Airtable Token in the field like shown below.

    ![image](https://github.com/initmahesh/MLAI-community-labs/assets/72710483/6dc34935-2fca-465a-8583-9f8ea33a7b74)

11. Now Click on `Save`

    ![image](https://github.com/initmahesh/MLAI-community-labs/assets/72710483/409589b5-4a57-4c13-82f8-2d897de99d61)

12. Now we need to go back to the CRM playbook again, so click on the playbook option in the side bar.
    ![image](./assets/images/7.png)

   <!--  ![image](https://github.com/initmahesh/MLAI-community-labs/assets/72710483/8ba5ebe0-70f3-4566-a7d7-32bebf72f675) -->

13. Click on the `CRM` playbook.

    ![image](./assets/images/8.png)

14. This Playbook will save the Name, Phone number and the Current Address of a Customer to the CRM, thus we set the instruction of the Agent.

```
  - Take the Name, Phone Number, Current Address and use ${TOOL:Airtable CRM} to save them in the CRM
  - Format the Phone Number as String before calling the tool.
```

![image](https://github.com/initmahesh/MLAI-community-labs/assets/72710483/74aea9bc-0e0c-4ed5-954c-cef1d1b0ea2a)

17. In the Available tools section you will see the tool that you just created for Airtable. Click on it.

    ![image](https://github.com/initmahesh/MLAI-community-labs/assets/72710483/7db6d767-0531-4dd9-a68e-61e7b91565d2)

18. Click on `Save`

    ![image](https://github.com/initmahesh/MLAI-community-labs/assets/72710483/47a0795d-4902-4e7b-9da7-f8629deef34f)

Now, your first agent is ready. Lets Configure our second agent.

## Configuration of the Second Playbook

1. Click on the back button shown below and set the car repair playbook as follows

   ![image](./assets/images/5.png)

2. Click on `Create` button

3. Set the name of the Playbook as `Car Repair`

4. Then we will set the Goal of the Agent

   In our case we are building a car repair agent who is helpful in answering questions related to the car problems. So we set the Goal as per the requirement as such.
   ![image](https://github.com/initmahesh/MLAI-community-labs/assets/72710483/87c68c43-a5a9-434c-9f54-354171c40753)

   Click the save button.

   ![image](https://github.com/initmahesh/MLAI-community-labs/assets/72710483/b62cac3a-bfcf-4180-9ba6-c16f8fa062fe)

5. Next step we will create a Tool for the agent to use.

   Head over to the Tools section and click on it
   ![image](https://github.com/initmahesh/MLAI-community-labs/assets/72710483/c0f1d2c1-6d20-4db4-a940-6d60b9ff8fca)

   Click on the create button. This is what you will be shown

   ![image](https://github.com/initmahesh/MLAI-community-labs/assets/72710483/05c4c377-f7a8-407d-84a1-b22bdde4052f)

   - Select the type of the tool as OpenAPI

     ![image](https://github.com/initmahesh/MLAI-community-labs/assets/72710483/670010a6-13a1-4ff1-91e5-26a2074f2f62)

   - Also set the description of the Tools. As we are integrating the Places API from Google we will set the description as that.

     ![image](https://github.com/initmahesh/MLAI-community-labs/assets/72710483/af74736d-1cec-43d7-9037-b42657dac564)

   - Now we will create an OpenAPI schema that we need to provide the tool for making API calls and getting the request. This will help the agent to know when it needs to call the API on its own, without having to explicitly mention it.

     **Open API schema**

     In our case we write the Open API schema in YAML format, but if you are already well versed in writing schema you can choose JSONL format too and try to create you own, else feel free to follow along.

   - - ```YAML
        openapi: 3.0.1
        info:
          title: Google Places Text Search API
          description: Search for places by text query.
          version: "1.0.0"
       ```

       In this sction we are mentioning the version of Open API schema that we will be using. We are going with the latest version currently.

       The **info** section mentions the title of the OpenAPI schema, the description of what this schema does and version of our schema.

   - - ```YAML
       servers:
           - url: https://places.googleapis.com/v1  # Base URL for the API
       ```
       Here, we are setting the base URL of the API, that the Agent is supposed to call.
   - - ```YAML
       paths:
         /places:searchText?fields=places.displayName,places.formatted_address,places.price_level:
           post:
       ```

       Here we are mentioning the path on which a Post request will be sent.

       (Notice how we have specified a query parameter in the path itself as (fields=places.displayName,places.formatted_address,places.price_level)? This is done because the Tools in Agent builder does not provide more than one field for mentioning the query parameter which is already taken up by the API key. Same goes for Request Headers.)

   - - ```YAML
       summary: Search for places by text query.
       operationId: searchPlaces
       requestBody:
         required: true
         content:
           application/json:
             schema:
               type: object
               properties:
                 textQuery:
                   type: string
                   description: Text query to search for places.
       ```

       The POST request sent should have a request body. So, here we are describing the requestBody and the contents of the requestBody. Also, the summary describes the POST request.

       The content section describes the type of the payload, and the properties describes the variables and they type with descriptions.

   - - ```YAML
       responses:
         '200':
           description: Successful response
           content:
             application/json:
               schema:
                 $ref: "#/components/schemas/placeResponse"
       ```

       This section mentions the responses, and their description and the content should be taken from the Path "#/components/schemas/placeResponse" which will be mentioned below.

   - - ```YAML
       components:
         schemas:
           placesNames:
             type: object
             properties:
               name:
                 type: string
                 description: Name of the place.
               formattedAddress:
                 type: string
                 description: Formatted address of the place.
               priceLevel:
                 type: string
                 description: Price level of the place (e.g., PRICE_LEVEL_EXPENSIVE).
           placeResponse:
             type: object
             properties:
               places:
                 type: array
                 items:
                   $ref: "#/components/schemas/placesNames"
       ```

       This section mentions the components that we are referencing in the point above as "#/components/schemas/placeResponse". So, lets understand the flow:

       Path: "#/components/schemas/placeResponse"

       References the PlaceResponse schema from the components section which in turn references "#/components/schemas/placesNames", this will call the placesNames schema that in turn mentions the contents and the description of each property.
       Properties:

       - - - name: The name of the place and type as string
           - formattedAddress: The formatted address of the place.
           - priceLevel: The pricing level of the place from high to low.

- The last step is to create the Instructions.

  In the Instructions set, you will need to mention the tool that you created along with the situation when the agent needs to call the tool and also the Agent name.

  ```
  ${TOOL: tool name}
  &{Playbook: Playbook name}

### Quick Note:

We mention the Agent to `use` a Tool whereas we mention it to `route to` another Agent while setting the instructions, else the Agent will hallucinate and not give proper results.
